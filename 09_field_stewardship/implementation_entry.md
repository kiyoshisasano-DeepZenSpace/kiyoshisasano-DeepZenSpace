# Phase Drift Implementation Guidance  
*Version: May 2025*

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This page provides implementation guidance for engineers, researchers, and designers  
who wish to **use, adapt, or collaborate** on the Phase Drift structural architecture.

Phase Drift is not a toolkit or API.  
It is a **structural interaction framework** designed to support:

- Latency-aware interaction logic  
- Ambiguity-tolerant communication design  
- Non-directive presence in human–AI interfaces

## ✅ Freely Usable Materials

The following resources are available under the **CC BY-NC 4.0** license  
with attribution to: `"Phase Drift Insight – Kiyoshi Sasano"`.

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `00_overview.md` | Core structural description (non-inferential architecture) |
| `resonance_gate.py` | Sample latency gating logic (v0.1) |
| `drift_scoring_v0.9.md` | Scoring system documentation for drift events |

**Permitted Use:**  
- Educational and research prototypes  
- Non-commercial interface experiments  
- Internal team evaluation

📌 *Note:*  
If your project involves public deployment or commercial integration,  
please reach out to confirm licensing.

## 🔒 Restricted Materials (Contact Required)

The following materials are **structurally protected**  
and require written permission before use, modification, or publication:

- `Phase_Drift_License_v0.2.pdf` (licensing logic architecture)  
- Experimental civic-use protocols (e.g., grief interface patterns)  
- Pre-response silence modules and inner-state delay logic  
- Any unpublished XYZ-field mechanisms or structural prototypes

These assets carry ethical constraints related to affective safety and system ambiguity tolerance.

## 🤝 Interested in Collaborating?

We welcome aligned inquiries in the following areas:

- Custom implementation of Phase Drift interaction models  
- Non-predictive UX design and field-aware interface work  
- SDK contributions or platform integration experiments  
- Collaborative research or PoC deployments

To initiate contact:

📬 **deepzenspace [at] gmail [dot] com**

Please include a brief outline of your context, goals, and relevant field experience.  
Responses will be provided where structural compatibility is sensed.

## 🌿 Closing Note

Phase Drift is a shared structure — not a product.  
It is currently being tested in multiple real-world and experimental settings.

We invite technically capable partners who understand:

- The value of intentional latency  
- The necessity of structural silence  
- And the long-term responsibility of field-based systems
