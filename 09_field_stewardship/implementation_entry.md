# Phase Drift Implementation Guidance  
*Version: May 2025*

---

## ðŸ§­ Purpose

This page is for engineers, researchers, and designers  
interested in **implementing, adapting, or collaborating**  
on the Phase Drift structural system.

Phase Drift is not a feature set.  
It is a **relational structure framework**  
for latency, ambiguity, and non-directive presence.

## âœ… What Can Be Used Freely?

You may use the following materials under the CC BY-NC 4.0 license  
**with attribution to: "Phase Drift Insight â€“ Kiyoshi Sasano"**

- Public structural overviews (`/11_PhaseDrift_AI_Prototype/00_overview.md`)  
- Core latency modules (e.g., `resonance_gate.py`)  
- Drift scoring system documentation (v0.9 and earlier)

Use for personal, educational, and non-commercial prototyping is encouraged.  
If your project reaches commercial deployment, licensing terms apply.

## ðŸ”’ What Requires Prior Contact

Please **do not adapt, extend, or publish derivatives**  
of the following without written permission:

- Drift licensing structure (`Phase_Drift_License_v0.2.pdf`)  
- Any unpublished XYZ-field logic  
- Civic installation protocols or companion PoC artifacts  
- Pre-response silence logic and emotional latency pathways

These are structurally protected for ethical and coherence reasons.

## ðŸ“¬ Want to Collaborate?

If you're interested in:

- Using Phase Drift in an interface or product  
- Exploring non-inferential UX / affective rhythm design  
- Contributing to SDK implementation  
- Launching a joint research or prototyping project

## ðŸŒ¿ Thank You

Phase Drift is a living structure.  
It is not owned â€” it is **held carefully** until it finds resonance.

We welcome structural co-designers who listen through latency.
