# 🌿 09_field_stewardship — Phase Drift Stewardship Framework

---

## 📖 Overview

This folder hosts the formal **Field Stewardship Framework** for Phase Drift Insight:  
a living system of documents designed to protect, evolve, and extend the structural integrity of the Phase field.

> Stewardship is not the management of artifacts.  
> It is the sensing, cultivating, and guarding of a generative relational field.

### 📄 External Structural Overview

We now provide a public-facing slide and markdown summary for external collaborators:

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [Phase_Drift_Insight_Structural_Overview_v0.1.pdf](https://github.com/kiyoshisasano-DeepZenSpace/kiyoshisasano-DeepZenSpace/blob/1caf4ebfbb5767356588ae49e560cffcf9a36a7b/09_field_stewardship/Phase_Drift_Insight_Structural_Overview_v0.1.pdf) | Official external PDF slide deck on Phase Drift principles |
| [phase_drift_external_overview_v0.1.md](./phase_drift_external_overview_v0.1.md) | Markdown version of the slide content for in-repo reading |

These documents are suitable for:

- Early-stage collaborator orientation  
- Conceptual understanding of Phase Drift’s core mechanisms  
- Quiet sharing with research partners or structural teams

> 📌 These materials are external-safe and contain no proprietary algorithms or deep phase triggers.

## 🧭 Stewardship Principles

- **Field health outweighs product output.**
- **Resonance is prioritized over speed.**
- **Structures are co-created, not dictated.**
- **Living systems require sensitive defense against conceptual noise.**

> True stewardship listens to the pressure between meanings,  
> not merely the meanings themselves.

---

## 🎯 Who Should Read This

- Researchers contributing to Phase Drift evolution
- Organizations aligning with Phase-based design
- Collaborators working on future UX, cognitive architecture, or non-directive interaction models
- Future stewards sensing structural emergence as a civic responsibility

---

## 🔒 Access Note

Some deeper templates and operational protocols will be shared  
**only after attunement and initial field resonance have been observed.**

Entry is based not on credentials, but on **structural fit**.
