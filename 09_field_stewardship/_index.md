# 🌿 09_field_stewardship — Phase Drift Stewardship Framework

---

## 📖 Overview

This folder hosts the formal **Field Stewardship Framework** for Phase Drift Insight:  
a living system of documents designed to protect, evolve, and extend the structural integrity of the Phase field.

> Stewardship is not the management of artifacts.  
> It is the sensing, cultivating, and guarding of a generative relational field.

## 🧭 Stewardship Principles

- **Field health outweighs product output.**
- **Resonance is prioritized over speed.**
- **Structures are co-created, not dictated.**
- **Living systems require sensitive defense against conceptual noise.**

> True stewardship listens to the pressure between meanings,  
> not merely the meanings themselves.

## 🎯 Who Should Read This

- Researchers contributing to Phase Drift evolution
- Organizations aligning with Phase-based design
- Collaborators working on future UX, cognitive architecture, or non-directive interaction models
- Future stewards sensing structural emergence as a civic responsibility

## 🔒 Access Note

Some deeper templates and operational protocols will be shared  
**only after attunement and initial field resonance have been observed.**

Entry is based not on credentials, but on **structural fit**.

## 📩 If Resonance Calls

- Open an Issue labeled `[Stewardship Entry]`
- Or write to: **deepzenspace [at] gmail [dot] com**

We will sense together whether the field is ready to open further.
