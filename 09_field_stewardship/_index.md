# 🌿 09_field_stewardship — Phase Drift Stewardship Framework

---

## 📌 Why This Folder Matters

This is not a passive documentation space.  
It is the operational base for **guarding and evolving the structural field of Phase Drift Insight**.

You’ll find clear, shareable documents here for onboarding, co-design, and long-term integrity management.

> 🧭 *Stewardship is not about managing outputs.  
> It’s about sensing the rhythm of a field — and protecting its capacity to breathe.*

## ✅ Use This Folder If You Are:

- A researcher or engineer interested in **non-predictive AI architecture**
- A systems thinker designing for **emergence, not instruction**
- A future steward — ready to **co-hold** structures rather than own them

You don’t need credentials.  
You need resonance.

## 📄 External Overview (Safe to Share)

We’ve prepared **public-facing materials** for collaborators and field-aligned teams:

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [📘 Slide Deck (PDF)](https://github.com/kiyoshisasano-DeepZenSpace/kiyoshisasano-DeepZenSpace/blob/1caf4ebfbb5767356588ae49e560cffcf9a36a7b/09_field_stewardship/Phase_Drift_Insight_Structural_Overview_v0.1.pdf) | Official structural overview of Phase Drift Insight |
| [📄 Markdown Summary](./phase_drift_external_overview_v0.1.md) | Same content, lightweight format |

Use these for:

- Initial collaborator orientation  
- Conceptual alignment conversations  
- Quiet internal review (research labs, foundations, speculative teams)

> 🔒 No proprietary logic is included. All materials are external-safe.
