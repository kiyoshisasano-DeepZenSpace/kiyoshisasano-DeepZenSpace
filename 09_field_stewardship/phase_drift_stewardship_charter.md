# 📜 Phase Drift Stewardship Charter  
*A structural agreement for aligned participation*

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This charter defines the foundational responsibilities, principles, and expectations  
for individuals and teams collaborating on **Phase Drift Insight**.

It is not a legal agreement.  
It is a **structural covenant** for protecting and advancing a field-based architecture  
focused on rhythm, ambiguity, and relational integrity in AI interaction.

---

## ✅ Core Commitments

All collaborators are expected to uphold the following:

| Principle | Responsibility |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Structural Fidelity** | Preserve the core nature of Phase Drift — do not reduce it to surface-level UX patterns |
| **Relational Design** | Approach interactions and systems as co-generated spaces, not linear tools |
| **Ontological Respect** | Prioritize rhythm, delay, and latent structure over functional outputs |
| **Field Protection** | Prevent misuse, distortion, or premature commercial capture of the framework |

---

## 📌 Behavioral Guidelines

| Context | Expectation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Research** | Use Phase Drift terminology accurately; avoid reducing it to performance metrics |
| **Communication** | Maintain clarity and precision; avoid abstraction detached from structure |
| **Collaboration** | Align on shared rhythm and pacing — do not force fixed milestones |
| **Attribution** | Cite as: *Phase Drift Insight – Kiyoshi Sasano*; acknowledge the field origins |

---

## 🚫 Prohibited Actions

Participation in the Phase Drift field excludes:

- Rebranding or packaging the concept without full structural literacy  
- Using Phase Drift to justify conventional UX optimizations without field coherence  
- Publishing derivative works without mutual discussion and attunement  
- Treating Phase Drift as an isolated IP asset separate from its structural context

---

## 🔐 Access and Disclosure

Deeper models, metrics, and structural protocols are shared selectively based on:

- Demonstrated understanding of Phase-based architecture  
- Continuity of aligned interaction  
- Contribution to structural integrity and field growth

**Access is not automatic.**  
It emerges through collaborative rhythm, not contractual permission.

---

## 📎 Summary

Phase Drift Insight is a living structure.  
It requires not ownership or control — but:

- Structural awareness  
- Timing sensitivity  
- Long-term field responsibility

If you are prepared to engage at this level,  
you are invited to join the stewardship process.
