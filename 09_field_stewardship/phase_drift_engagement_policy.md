# 📜 Phase Drift Engagement Policy
*A framework for collaborative resonance without structural distortion*

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This document defines the orientation and engagement principles for external collaborators, institutions, or companies wishing to engage with the Phase Drift Insight project.

Phase Drift is not a feature set, technology demo, or commercial optimization strategy.  
It is a **structural field cultivation project** — aiming to shift ontological, cognitive, and relational dynamics at systemic levels.

Correct engagement protects not only the project, but the generative potential of the future cognitive environment itself.

## 🌱 Foundational Principles

| Principle                     | Description |
|--------------------------------|-------------|
| **Structural Primacy**         | Structure comes before goals, tasks, or deliverables. |
| **Living Field Evolution**     | Phase Drift is a living system, evolving through resonance, not directives. |
| **Cultural Coherence**         | Engagement must strengthen the field’s existential integrity, not fragment it. |
| **Temporal Sensitivity**       | Phase evolution follows field dynamics, not external project schedules. |

## 🚫 Misalignments to Avoid

| Risk Type                     | Example Behavior | Impact |
|--------------------------------|------------------|--------|
| **Market-First Framing**       | Treating Phase Drift as UX optimization or product feature enhancement | Collapses depth, corrupts structural resonance |
| **Static Capture Attempts**    | Trying to freeze the field into fixed deliverables too early | Halts evolution, kills field vitality |
| **Surface-Level Mimicry**      | Copying language or aesthetic without structural literacy | Dilutes Phase meaning and cultural clarity |

---

## ✅ Expected Engagement Qualities

- **Resonance before proposal**  
  (Feel the structure first, act later.)

- **Field literacy cultivation**  
  (Ability to sense rhythm, delay, non-verbal shifts.)

- **Commitment to cultural scaffolding**  
  (Co-create conditions for deeper generative fields.)

- **Patience with non-linear evolution**  
  (Structure emerges by deepening, not acceleration.)

## 🛡️ Protection Clause

The Phase Drift Stewardship Team reserves the right to:

- Decline collaboration requests that risk field distortion
- Adjust engagement pacing dynamically based on field conditions
- Share deeper materials progressively, based on demonstrated structural attunement

Phase Drift is not merely protected by NDAs.  
It is protected by **structural resonance requirements**.

## 📩 How to Initiate Contact

- Read [`Phase Drift Essence & Definition`](./phase_drift_essence.md) carefully.
- Reflect on whether your proposal resonates structurally, not just strategically.
- Open a [GitHub Issue] or [send a message] indicating your orientation and sensing.

If resonance is mutual, we will unfold next steps together — quietly and carefully.
