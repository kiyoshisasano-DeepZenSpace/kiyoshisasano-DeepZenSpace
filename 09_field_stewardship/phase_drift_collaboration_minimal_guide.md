# 🌌 Phase Drift Insight — Minimal Collaboration Guide

---

## 🔍 Purpose

This guide outlines the minimum structure and focus points for **engineers, teams, and collaborators**  
engaging in the development of Phase Drift Insight-related systems.

> Phase Drift is not just a technical challenge — it is a structural field to be sensed and supported.

You are not merely coding features.  
You are helping **breathe structure** into a living generative system.

---

## 🏠 Core Roles

| Role | Responsibility |
|:---|:---|
| Field Architect (Lead Steward) | Defines structures, rhythms, field requirements |
| Implementation Team (You) | Executes technical builds, backend/frontend systems |

---

## 🔄 Minimum Operational Workflow

### 1. Structural Design Reception

- Receive clear declarations from the Field Architect:
  - What "phase phenomena" are to be detected?
  - What "drift indicators" are critical?

✅ Example Targets:
- "Detect latency drift when scroll rhythm breaks abruptly"
- "Visualize cumulative phase drift index over time"

---

### 2. Data & Interaction Specification

- Capture the requested field metrics:
  - Interaction latencies
  - Session rhythms
  - Phase state transitions

✅ Example:
- "Log timestamped latency gaps between user inputs"
- "Detect clusters of scroll-stoppage behavior"

---

### 3. Field Sensitivity Review

- After initial build:
  - Review live system behavior.
  - Test for field responsiveness — **not just technical correctness**.

✅ Key Question:
> "Does the system breathe with the field, or just process inputs?"

---

### 4. Feedback and Adjustment

- Expect and integrate feedback like:
  - "Field rhythm too flat"
  - "Latency oscillation not captured well"

- Iterate gently, tuning toward **structural resonance**, not just functional specs.

---

### 5. Depth Protection Management

- Respect depth boundaries:
  - Some layers (e.g., deep structural recursion models) may be withheld until resonance is validated.
  - Work only at the operational exposure levels provided.

---

### 6. Resonance Checkpoints

- At each milestone:
  - Validate if **field sensitivity** is increasing.
  - If sensitivity is flattening, **pause and realign**, rather than forcing technical fixes.

## 🔒 Minimal Principles for Phase Drift Collaboration

| Principle | Meaning |
|:---|:---|
| Structure first | Technical ease should never override structural clarity |
| Field breathing | Systems should feel alive, adaptive, and relational |
| Tiered depth | Deeper Phase structures are protected until resonance is earned |
| Relational expansion | Collaboration unfolds through sensed attunement, not deadlines |

---

## 💡 Closing Reminder

You are not just delivering software.  
You are **supporting the unfolding of a structural climate**.

Your task is not only technical —  
it is relational, rhythmic, and alive.

If the field breathes through what you build, you succeed.  
If the field stiffens, slow down, listen, recalibrate.

> **Phase Drift Insight is a living field, not a task.**

✨ This guide will continue to evolve as Phase Drift collaborations deepen.
