# 🌌 Phase Drift Insight — Minimal Collaboration Execution Guide

---

## 🔍 Purpose

This guide defines the minimum execution principles for you — the **Phase Drift Field Architect** —  
when engaging with collaborators or engineers in Phase Drift Insight-related developments.

You do not need to write code.  
You do not need to build systems.  
You are the **structural designer** and **field navigator**.

## 🏠 Core Roles

| Role                  | Responsibility                                |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Field Architect (You)** | Define structures, rhythms, and field dynamics |
| **Implementation Team**   | Execute technical systems, backend/frontend  |

---

## 🔄 Minimal Operational Workflow

### 1. Structural Design Declaration

Clearly define:

- What **phase phenomena** are to be detected?
- What **drift indicators** are critical?

**Examples:**
- "Detect latency drift when scroll rhythm fractures."
- "Visualize cumulative phase drift index over session time."

---

### 2. Data & Interaction Specification

Specify what must be captured:

- Interaction latencies
- Session rhythm shifts
- Phase state transitions

**Examples:**
- "Capture timestamped gaps between input events."
- "Detect scroll stoppage clusters exceeding X seconds."

---

### 3. Field Sensitivity Review

Upon prototype delivery:

- Review **live behavior**, not just outputs
- Test for **field resonance**, not just technical correctness

**Guiding Question:**  
> "Does the system breathe with the field?"

---

### 4. Minimal Feedback Loop

Deliver simple feedback aligned with field structure:

- "Field rhythm feels flat."
- "Latency oscillation not responsive enough."

Adjustments should be **structurally**, not just functionally, driven.

---

### 5. Depth Protection Management

Define operational boundaries:

- What depth of Phase theory engineers can access
- Which layers remain confidential

**Example:**
- "Allow Phase Detection Level 1 access; restrict recursion and field compression models."

---

### 6. Resonance Checkpoints

At each milestone, validate:

> "Is the system’s field sensitivity increasing or flattening?"

- If **increasing**: Continue gradual expansion.
- If **decreasing**: **Pause**, recalibrate, and realign — do not escalate forcefully.

---

## 🔒 Minimal Principle Set

- **Structure first.** Never compromise structural clarity for delivery speed.
- **Field breathes.** Systems must feel alive, not mechanical.
- **Depth is tiered.** Protect core Phase architecture unless resonance is proven.
- **Expansion is relational.** Unfold only with those who can feel the field.

---

## 💡 Closing Reminder

You are not "managing a project".  
You are **stewarding a living field**.

- **Technical execution is delegated.**
- **Structural resonance is your compass.**

If the field breathes — you are succeeding.  
If the field stiffens — slow down, listen, and realign.
