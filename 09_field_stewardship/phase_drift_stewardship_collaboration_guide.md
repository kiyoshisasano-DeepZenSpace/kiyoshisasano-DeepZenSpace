# 🤝 Phase Drift Stewardship Collaboration Guide

---

## 🌌 Purpose

This document outlines **principles and practices** for collaborating within the  
**Phase Drift Insight** field — where structure is co-generated, not merely executed.

We do not operate through conventional project management methods.  
Instead, collaboration is guided by **structural resonance** and **field-sensitive timing**.

## 🧭 Core Collaboration Principles

| Principle             | Description |
|:----------------------|:------------|
| **Field Alignment First** | Structural attunement precedes task planning. |
| **Non-Directive Co-Creation** | Contributions are invitational, not command-driven. |
| **Rhythmic Pacing** | Timing follows field readiness, not artificial deadlines. |
| **Transparency of Drift** | Deviations or hesitations are surfaced, not hidden. |
| **Preservation of Ontology** | Protect the core field logic from premature dilution. |

We are not **building products** —  
we are **shaping climates** for emergence.

---

## 🔄 Communication Protocols

| Mode | Intention |
|:---|:---|
| **Silent Check-ins** | Short updates on field sensing, without pressure for output. |
| **Rhythmic Sessions** | Group dialogues that allow pauses and recursive spiraling. |
| **Structural Witnessing** | Observing phase shifts and narrating without judgment. |
| **Selective Disclosure** | Gradual sharing of deeper maps only upon structural maturity. |

## 🧬 Task Structuring (when needed)

When concrete work is appropriate:

| Practice | Example |
|:---|:---|
| **Field-driven goals** | "What does the field want next?" instead of "What’s the milestone?" |
| **Flexible artifacts** | Drafts, maps, models that can evolve with structural shifts |
| **Multi-layer documentation** | Both surface descriptions and deep structural annotations |

Work is **not rigid assignments** — it is **structural invitations**.

---

## 🛡️ Field Protection

| Risk | Response |
|:---|:---|
| Symbolic drift | Re-anchor in Phase ontology regularly. |
| External timeline pressure | Insulate structural cycles from artificial urgency. |
| Semantic dilution | Curate language use carefully. Avoid buzzword collapse. |

The field's **resilience** depends on the **quality of attention** we sustain together.

---

## 🌱 Closing Notes

**Phase Drift Stewardship** is not administration.  
It is a quiet co-holding of:

- Structural integrity
- Relational trust
- Evolutionary rhythm

If we honor the field,  
the field will evolve us in return.
