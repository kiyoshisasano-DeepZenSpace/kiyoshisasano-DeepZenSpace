# 🤝 Phase Drift Stewardship Collaboration Guide  
*Guidelines for collaborative alignment in structural fields*

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This guide defines how to collaborate within the **Phase Drift Insight** project.

Unlike conventional project management, Phase Drift work is:

- **Field-sensitive**  
- **Timing-aware**  
- **Structurally co-generated**

You are not executing tasks.  
You are engaging a **responsive structure** that unfolds through interaction.

## 🧭 Core Collaboration Principles

| Principle                     | Description |
|------------------------------|-------------|
| **Alignment Before Action**   | Structural sensing comes before task definition |
| **Non-Directive Contribution**| Participation is based on invitation and rhythm, not assignment |
| **Field-Timed Pacing**        | Work cadence follows internal system readiness — not external deadlines |
| **Transparent Drift Awareness** | Deviations or pauses are discussed, not hidden |
| **Ontology Preservation**     | Core concepts must not be diluted or redefined without alignment |

This is not product management —  
this is **climate-responsive co-design**.

## 🔄 Communication Practices

| Mode                   | Purpose |
|------------------------|---------|
| **Silent Check-ins**    | Brief updates or reflections, no output pressure |
| **Rhythmic Sessions**   | Dialogues with room for pauses and structural spirals |
| **Phase Observation**   | Noting subtle changes in team rhythm, coherence, and emergence |
| **Selective Disclosure**| Deep materials are shared progressively based on demonstrated fit |

Shared awareness is prioritized over velocity.

## 🧬 Structuring Tasks (When Necessary)

When coordination becomes concrete:

| Method                   | Example |
|--------------------------|---------|
| **Field-Driven Objectives** | "What is the structural tension asking for?" instead of "What is the goal?" |
| **Flexible Outputs**        | Sketches, drafts, documents that adapt to field evolution |
| **Multi-Layered Notation**  | Include both technical content and structural rationale where relevant |

Execution follows field pressure — not roadmap timelines.

## 🛡️ Field Protection Guidelines

| Concern              | Protective Practice |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Symbolic Drift**     | Periodic review of core concepts to avoid misalignment |
| **External Deadline Pressure** | Maintain structural cycle integrity over delivery urgency |
| **Conceptual Dilution** | Curate terminology carefully; avoid trend-based framing |

Preserving coherence is a shared responsibility —  
not just a leadership task.

---

## ✅ Summary

Collaborating in Phase Drift Insight requires:

- Awareness of rhythm and structural timing  
- Respect for layered emergence  
- Comfort with ambiguity and gradual unfolding  

This approach enables new types of systems and relationships  
that are not optimized — but **attuned**.
