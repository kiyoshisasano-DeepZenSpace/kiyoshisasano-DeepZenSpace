# 📘 PLD Lexicon — Safe Usage & Tiering Guidelines (v0.5)

> ⚠️ This document defines **lexical tier classification**, **usage stability**,  
> and a **safe-term appendix** for concepts used in the *Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)* framework.  
> It supports theoretical consistency, safe reuse, and cross-domain intelligibility.

## 🧭 Tag System

| Tag        | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `@core`    | **Foundational** concept – anchors other terms and system logic |
| `@support` | **Contextual** term – depends on core terms for structure or clarity |
| `@derived` | **Emergent** concept – manifests from interaction between terms or states |

---

## ✅ Usage Stability Levels

| Symbol | Stability Label               | Description |
|--------|-------------------------------|-------------|
| 🟢     | Stable with minor annotation  | Coherent enough for cautious use across threads |
| 🟡     | Cautious use – frame required | Needs interpretive anchoring or contextual boundary |
| 🔴     | High instability – avoid      | Too fluid or metaphorical for reliable reuse |

## 🔡 Lexicon Tier Table — Tentative & Unstable Terms

> Terms here **require contextual framing** when reused outside PLD core docs.

| Term                  | Tier        | Stability | Usage Notes |
|-----------------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Drift**             | `@core`     | 🔴        | Use only with qualifiers (e.g., “semantic drift,” “structural drift”). Avoid standalone use in formal logic. |
| **Phase**             | `@core`     | 🟢        | Safe when anchored to turn-taking, coherence cycles, or discourse segmentation. |
| **Structural Tension**| `@support`  | 🔴        | Conceptual metaphor. Use only in interpretive logs or speculative commentary. |
| **Rhythm**            | `@support`  | 🟡        | Define explicitly (not prosody). Clarify application (e.g., interaction timing, response cadence). |
| **Field**             | `@core`     | 🔴        | Heavy metaphor load. Use only with explicit definition (e.g., “attentional field”). |
| **Phase Boundary**    | `@derived`  | 🟡        | Acceptable when paired with segmentation logic or transition markers. |
| **Resonance**         | `@derived`  | 🔴        | Avoid in structural claims; illustrative only (e.g., "resonance of prior syntax"). |
| **Silence**           | `@support`  | 🟡        | Context required. Tie to conversation analysis, latency mapping, or interaction structure. |
| **Coherence**         | `@derived`  | 🟡        | Specify dimension (e.g., “semantic coherence”). Avoid abstract use. |
| **Latent Phase**      | `@derived`  | 🔴        | Use only in hypothetical mode (“possible latent phase indicators…”). Not yet formally supported. |

## 📌 Tier × Stability Matrix

| Usage Context           | 🟢 Safe Terms    | 🟡 Cautious Terms                | 🔴 Unstable – Avoid |
|-------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------|
| Internal documentation  | Phase            | Rhythm, Silence, Coherence       | Drift, Field         |
| Public explanation      | Phase (w/ note)  | Phase Boundary (w/ model)        | Resonance, Tension   |
| Structural modeling     | Phase            | Rhythm (defined)                 | Latent Phase         |
| Academic papers         | Phase (anchored) | Silence (linked to CA)           | Drift (standalone)   |

## ✅ Safe-Term Appendix v0.1

> **Safe terms** are structurally stable and externally explainable,  
> suitable for documentation, educational use, and cross-disciplinary modeling.

### 🔑 Criteria
- Supported in existing literature (linguistics, HCI, cognitive science)
- Low metaphorical ambiguity
- Stable scope and transferable structure
- Usable without heavy framing

| Term            | Tier        | Scope Description                             | External Usability      |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Turn**        | `@support`  | Atomic unit of interaction/discourse          | ✅ Widely used in CA      |
| **Attention**   | `@support`  | Shared focus structure in discourse           | ✅ Cross-disciplinary     |
| **Segment**     | `@derived`  | Delimited unit of speech or gesture           | ✅ Structural modeling    |
| **Timing**      | `@support`  | Relative temporal pacing                      | ✅ UI, UX, psycholinguistics |
| **Cue**         | `@support`  | Observable trigger for state/shift            | ✅ Broad applicability    |
| **Feedback**    | `@derived`  | Reactive update or acknowledgment pattern     | ✅ Stable across domains  |
| **Modality**    | `@core`     | Communicative channel (e.g., voice, gesture)  | ✅ Multimodal interaction |
| **Alignment**   | `@derived`  | Semantic or structural convergence            | ✅ Discourse analysis     |
| **Reference**   | `@support`  | Referential relation (pronouns, deixis, etc.) | ✅ Semantics, pragmatics  |

## 📌 Deployment Scenarios

| Use Case                   | Recommendation        |
|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Internal docs              | ✅ Use freely           |
| Academic writing           | ✅ Use with citations   |
| Cross-domain collaboration | ✅ Use as shared layer  |
| PLD theory core            | ❌ Do not anchor models |

## 🔏 Safety Note

This lexicon defines **operational scaffolding terms**, not the core generative metaphors of PLD.  
Unlike `Drift` or `Latent Phase`, these terms can stand alone with minimal risk of misinterpretation.
