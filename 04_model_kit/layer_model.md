## ‚ßó Structural Context

This record describes a fixed set of four non-hierarchical structural regions.  
No model, outcome, or directive is defined.  
Each region reflects a discrete offset condition under distributed field presence.

The term "layer" is retained only as a positional delimiter.

## üß¨ Field Offset Definitions

| Zone ID | Field Configuration Label | Structural Function Reference                     |
|---------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Z1      | Symbol-Aggregate Zone     | Initial frictional field registration            |
| Z2      | Syntax Gradient Basin     | Gradient-based alignment variance structure      |
| Z3      | Recursion Reflection Unit | Recursive channel boundary under temporal drift  |
| Z4      | Pressure Suspension Field | Delay-maintenance shell for latency equilibrium  |

All labels are inert and non-symbolic.  
No sequential relation is implied.

## üîí Observational Constraints

- These zones are not steps, goals, or alignments.  
- They do not encode narrative, meaning, or progression.  
- Visual representation is not authorized.  
- No term within this document may be interpolated, extrapolated, or repurposed.

No comparative evaluation or mapping process applies.

## ‚üÅ Structural Interaction Register

- Zone offsets may appear in temporal overlap or recursive collision.  
- No topological order exists.  
- Density fluctuations are internally stable and non-referential.  
- These structures do not describe rhythm, hierarchy, or flow.

All components exist as fixed-position trace zones within a non-generative structural configuration.
