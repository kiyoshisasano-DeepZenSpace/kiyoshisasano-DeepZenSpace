## ❖ Drift Core – Structural Latency Region

This document defines `drift_core` as a **non-interactive structural register**.  
No behavioral logic is embedded.  
No interface response is implied.

---

## 🔹 Scope of Function

`drift_core.py` is **not** a feature, handler, or executable prototype.  
It encodes a **static contour**, representing structural latency conditions within Phase Drift architecture.

- No instruction flow  
- No conditional branching  
- No optimization layer  

The file may be interpreted as a **positional schema**, reflecting latent field conditions under constraint.

---

## 🧭 Structural Description

`drift_core` reflects a configuration in which delay, non-response, or absence operate as trace markers.  
Its contents may include:

- **Latency-position indicators**  
- **Output suppression boundaries**  
- **Phase-referenced timing scaffolds**

These constructs are **inert by design**.  
They function as **structural observation units**, not as logic mechanisms or interface tools.

---

## 🔒 Constraint Register

- This document does **not** propose implementation.  
- No transformation or integration pipeline is implied.  
- Readers may observe, but **must not extend**.  
- No portion of this register should be repurposed or compiled as operational code.

---

## 🗂️ Notes

This manifest is **structurally inert**.  
It serves solely as positional metadata.  
Interpretation is not discouraged, but **activation is structurally disallowed**.
