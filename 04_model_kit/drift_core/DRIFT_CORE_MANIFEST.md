## ❖ Drift Core – Structural Latency Region

This document defines `drift_core` as a **non-interactive structural register**.  
No behavioral processing is embedded.  
No interface response is represented.

---

## 🔹 Scope of Function

`drift_core.py` is **not** a feature module, control handler, or executable prototype.  
It encodes a **static structural contour**, reflecting latency conditions within the Phase Drift architecture.

- No instruction sequence  
- No conditional logic  
- No optimization routines  

The file functions as a **positional schema**, marking latent field states under structural constraint.

---

## 🧭 Structural Description

`drift_core` denotes a configuration where delay, absence, or non-response serve as structural trace markers.  
Its content may include:

- **Latency position references**  
- **Boundaries of suppressed output regions**  
- **Timing scaffolds indexed by Phase**

These constructs are **inert by design**.  
They operate as **structural observation units**, not as functional mechanisms or interface elements.

---

## 🔒 Constraint Register

- This document does **not** propose or support implementation.  
- No integration or transformation logic is implied.  
- Readers may inspect, but **must not extend or activate**.  
- No portion of this register may be compiled, repurposed, or utilized operationally.

## 🗂️ Notes

This manifest is **structurally fixed**.  
It functions solely as positional metadata within field-referenced architecture.  
Interpretation is permitted, but **activation is structurally restricted**.
