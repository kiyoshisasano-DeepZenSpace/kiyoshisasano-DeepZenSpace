## ❖ Drift Core – Structural Latency Region

This document describes `drift_core` as a non-interactive structural register.  
No behavioral logic is embedded.  
No interface response is implied.

---

## 🔹 Scope of Function

`drift_core.py` is not a feature, handler, or prototype.  
It encodes a static contour — representing structural latency conditions under Phase Drift architecture.

- No instruction flow  
- No conditional branching  
- No optimization layer  

The file may be **read as a positional schema**, reflecting latent field conditions under constraint.

---

## 🧭 Structural Description

`drift_core` reflects a configuration state in which delay, non-response, or absence function as trace conditions.  
The code may contain:

- Latency-position markers  
- Output suppression boundaries  
- Phase-referenced timing scaffolds  

These constructs **are inert by default**.  
They exist as **structural observation units**, not as interface logic.

---

## 🔒 Constraint Register

- This document does not propose implementation.  
- No transformation or integration process is assumed.  
- Readers may observe, but not extend.  
- No part of this register should be recompiled as operational code.  

---

## 🗂️ Notes

This manifest is inert.  
It serves as positional metadata only.  
Interpretation is not discouraged, but **activation is structurally disallowed**.
