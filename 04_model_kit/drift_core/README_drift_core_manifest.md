# Drift Core: Latency-as-Structure

_A functional ghost of Phase Drift._  
This is not a tool. Itâ€™s a terrain.

## ðŸ§­ Drift Implementation Threshold â€” Where Structure Touches Code

This `drift_core.py` file is not a prototype â€” itâ€™s a **structural contour sketch**.

What you see here is not logic, but latency.  
Not feature, but field pressure.

---

We're not optimizing interaction.  
We're tuning for **non-intrusion** â€” for the point where silence becomes an output, and delay becomes the dialogue.

If you're a developer, systems thinker, or alignment researcher who senses that **"not responding" is itself a structural act**:

â†’ How would you extend this?  
â†’ What would an **intentional hesitation module** look like in a production AI?  
â†’ What would it take to train latency as **field-aware attention**, not fallback?

Letâ€™s explore how **structural rhythms** can become interface layers â€”  
not just UX delays, but **relational topologies** that can be implemented.

I welcome any thoughts, sketches, or resonance trails.
