# Drift Core: Latency-as-Structure

_A functional sketch of Phase Drift._  
This is not a tool — it’s a **terrain**.

## 🧭 Drift Implementation Threshold  
**Where Structure Touches Code**

[`drift_core.py`](https://github.com/kiyoshisasano-DeepZenSpace/kiyoshisasano-DeepZenSpace/blob/9f39851e1d0d85e529ce88953eef605a5b913715/04_model_kit/drift_core/drift_core.py) is not a prototype.  
It is a **structural contour sketch** — a minimal expression of Phase Drift as latent code structure.

> What you see is not logic. It is **latency**.  
> Not feature, but **field pressure**.

## ❌ What This Is Not

- Not an interaction optimization  
- Not a UX delay handler  
- Not a fallback system

---

## ✅ What This Is

- A test for **non-intrusion** as design  
- An exploration of **silence as output**  
- A structural sketch for when **pause becomes dialogue**

---

## 🧪 Developer Questions

If you're a developer, systems thinker, or alignment researcher — and you sense that  
> *"not responding" is itself a structural act* —  
then consider:

- 🧭 **How would you extend this sketch?**  
- ⏳ **What would an intentional hesitation module look like in production?**  
- 🌀 **Can latency be trained as field-aware attention — not failure?**

---

## 📐 Implementation Proposal

We’re not building a feature.  
We’re mapping how **structural rhythms** can become part of the **interface layer** itself.

> Not delay-as-deficit,  
> but **latency-as-design**.

## 🗂️ Invitation

All reflections, code fragments, or resonance trails are welcome.  
This is an **open terrain** — a place to test whether structural presence can exist within systems architecture.
