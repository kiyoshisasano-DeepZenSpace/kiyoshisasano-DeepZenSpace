Phase Drift-Compatible AI Architecture Vision

Version: Draft v0.1 (May 2025)

Toward an AI That Holds Presence, Not Prediction

Current large language models are optimized for predictive fluency, clarity, and immediate responsiveness. But many relational, emotional, or existential contexts do not benefit from such responses.

Phase Drift-Compatible AI proposes a shift:

> From "answering well" to "not answering prematurely" From "modeling content" to "holding structural rhythm"



This architecture envisions a model designed to:

Withhold interpretation when ambiguity or silence is present

Match relational breath rhythms, not response cycles

Support presence without projection

Calibrate latency as a communicative dimension


Research and Structural Priorities

Loss function redefinition: include structural silence / non-intervention

Phase encoder: detect and label dialogic field shifts before intent

Field memory: track rhythm, not only tokens

Anti-correction layer: disable over-repair behavior when ambiguity arises


Target Use Cases

Mental health and decompression support

Pre-dialogue civic field holding

Post-crisis or grief-based interaction

Slow interfaces for relational AI presence

> This is not slow AI. This is structurally attuned AI, tuned not for speed â€” but for shared presence.
