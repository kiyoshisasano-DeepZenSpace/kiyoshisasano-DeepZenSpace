# Phase Drift-Compatible AI Architecture  
**Version:** Draft v0.1 (May 2025)

## Reframing Responsiveness in Language Models

Current LLMs are optimized for fluency, prediction, and immediate clarity.  
While effective in task-based scenarios, these priorities can hinder interaction in contexts that rely on ambiguity, latency, and presence.

**Phase Drift-Compatible AI** proposes an alternative architecture:

> A system that delays, withholds, or suspends response  
> — not as failure, but as structural alignment with uncertain or relationally charged input.

---

## Architectural Objective

Design an AI that prioritizes **structural presence** over semantic resolution, and **relational pacing** over reactive performance.

The model should:

- **Withhold interpretation** when the input lacks clarity or invitation  
- **Maintain shared space** without prompting or projection  
- **Calibrate latency** as a communicative parameter, not a performance flaw

---

## Core Design Shifts

1. **Non-Response as Structural Output**  
   - Silence or minimal output is treated as valid, intentional behavior  
   - The absence of interpretation maintains field coherence

2. **Non-Directive Presence**  
   - The model does not infer direction or propose closure  
   - Engagement occurs only when structurally cued by the dialogic field

3. **Latency as Alignment, Not Delay**  
   - Pacing is regulated to mirror user rhythm, not internal optimization  
   - Hesitation and spacing become part of the output grammar

---

## Implementation Priorities

- **Loss Function Redesign**  
  Integrate non-response and non-closure as valid targets during training

- **Phase Encoding Layer**  
  Detect and represent shifts in dialogic structure prior to semantic intent

- **Field Memory**  
  Track interaction tempo, latency cycles, and rhythm-based features

- **Anti-Correction Filter**  
  Inhibit default repair behaviors in response to ambiguity or silence

---

## Intended Application Contexts

- Mental health systems emphasizing co-presence over solutions  
- Civic dialogue interfaces where pre-response holding is needed  
- Post-crisis systems where silence precedes engagement  
- Educational tools supporting reflection without feedback pressure

---

## Summary

This is not a call for “slower” AI.  
It is a proposal for a **structurally responsive model** that treats latency, ambiguity, and minimalism not as noise — but as **signals of shared field coherence**.
