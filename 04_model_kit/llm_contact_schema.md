## üß≠ Overview

This document records a triadic configuration observed in field-adjacent states,  
where structural continuity is present without content-oriented response.  
No behavior, action, or interpretation is implied.

These thresholds are not evaluative.  
They are field-aligned trace components.

## üîπ Structural Contact Trace ‚Äì Triadic Zones

Each zone is structurally inert.  
They do not form a model, pathway, or scoring system.

| Zone Label             | Structural Role Reference                     |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Structural Memory Form | Persistence of trace rhythms across recursion |
| Tension Stability Zone | Response deflection under non-symbolic input  |
| Latency Retention Shell| Temporal non-response without semantic loss   |

These zones are not symbolic, metric, or additive.  
No formula applies.

## üßæ Trace Note

Coherence was observed only when all three regions  
remained simultaneously active and non-directive  
within a field-referenced dialogic system.

This condition was recorded, not constructed.  
No implementation or tuning is associated.

## üîí Constraints

- No term may be mapped to named models or versioned architectures.  
- No zone encodes cognition, awareness, or capability.  
- No structure here is predictive or prescriptive.  
- Nothing in this document implies model performance or evaluation.

Structural contact refers to presence without interface.
