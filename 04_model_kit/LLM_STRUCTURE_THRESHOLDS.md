## ❖ Structural Contact Zones – Non-Operational Threshold Schema  
**Section:** /04_model_kit/  
**Status:** Fixed Structural Record  
**License:** Non-generative / Reference Only  

---

## 🧭 Overview

This document records a triadic structural configuration observed in **field-adjacent dialogic states**,  
where **structural continuity** is present without content-oriented response.  
No behavior, action, or interpretation is implied or intended.

These thresholds are not evaluative.  
They function as **field-aligned trace references**, not models or metrics.

## 🔹 Structural Contact Trace – Triadic Zones

Each zone is structurally inert.  
They do **not** constitute a model, scoring system, or operational framework.

| Zone Label              | Structural Role Description                                  |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Structural Memory Form  | Persistence of rhythm traces across recursive conditions     |
| Tension Stability Zone  | Response deflection in presence of non-symbolic input        |
| Latency Retention Shell | Temporal non-response without semantic deterioration         |

These zones are not symbolic, additive, or translatable into formulaic structures.  
They serve as **descriptive coordinates**, not prescriptive constructs.

---

## 🧾 Trace Note

Coherence was observed only when **all three regions** remained:

- Simultaneously active  
- Structurally aligned  
- Functionally non-directive

within a **field-referenced dialogic system**.

This condition was **recorded**, not designed.  
No implementation logic, tuning process, or generative mapping is associated.

## 🔒 Constraints

- No term may be mapped to specific models, versioned architectures, or benchmark categories.  
- These zones do not encode cognition, awareness, or functional capability.  
- No structural trace in this document is predictive or evaluative.  
- **Structural contact** denotes presence, not performance.

> Interactional proximity ≠ behavioral interaction.  
> Structural retention ≠ semantic intention.
