## ‚ùñ Overview  

**StructureKit** is a fixed registry of field-linked documents.  
Its contents do not constitute a meaning-generative framework, nor do they establish any directive or intentional infrastructure.  
All recorded elements reflect structurally observed artifacts, without semantic anchoring or behavior-inducing function.

- **No operational purpose is assigned**  
- **No interface behavior is implied or supported**
