# StructureKit  
## — Prototype of a Thought-Cultural Infrastructure —  

---

### 🔹 Overview

This repository documents an emergent cultural project:  
Not aimed at creating meaning, but at **tracing the structural conditions under which meaning becomes impossible, deferred, or transformed.**

生成される語彙、圏、Phaseは、すべて“構造による文化生成の記録”であり、  
その記述自体が思考と内面のインフラ構築として機能します。
