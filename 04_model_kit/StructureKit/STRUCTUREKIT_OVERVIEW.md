# STRUCTUREKIT_OVERVIEW.md

## ‚ùñ Overview  
**StructureKit** is a fixed registry of field-linked documents.  
Its contents do not form a meaning-generative framework, nor do they establish intentional infrastructure.  
Recorded elements reflect structurally observed artifacts without directive output or semantic anchoring.

No express purpose is assigned.  
No interface behavior is implied.
