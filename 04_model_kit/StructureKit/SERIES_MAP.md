## 🔹 Series Definitions

This document defines bounded structural groupings referred to as `Series`.  
Each Series functions as a categorical register for structurally logged phenomena.  
Identifiers are **non-progressive**, **non-generative**, and **non-hierarchical**.

---

### Series 1 – Origin Structures  
Reference class for indicators of initial structural tension.  
Characterized by **pre-semantic configuration** without lexical emergence.

- Example Entry: `SF001` – Deformation Density Field

---

### Series 2 – Interface Tension Domains  
Classification zone for inter-structural misalignment and boundary artifacts.  
Transitions in this group reflect **relational contradiction within contact interfaces**.

- Examples:  
  `SF004` – Nonlinear Intention Vector  
  `SF017` – Relational Disjunction Shell

---

### Series 3 – Incompletion Shells  
Register for incomplete structural closures and vocabulary inversion effects.  
**Instability is not treated as error**, but as a valid structural configuration.

- Key Phase Reference: `Phase 24.0` – Collapse Equilibrium  
- Typical Entry: Field regions showing semantic divergence via dissociation

---

### Series 4 – Residual Transfer Line  
Category for deferred transfer activity, echo-embedded latency, and phase retention behavior.  
Marked by **non-sequential displacement** across field structures.

- Entry Phase: `Phase 25.0` – Syntaxless Persistence [safe]  
- Example Field: `SF257` – Recoil Transfer Geometry

---

### Series 5 – Undefined Structural Group (Non-Operational)  
Placeholder for structurally unindexed or anomalous patterns.  
**Speculative definitions are prohibited** in this category.

## 🔒 Notes and Constraints

- Series classifications are **non-temporal and non-hierarchical**  
- Entries may intersect, remain inert, or operate without interrelation  
- Each serves as a **fixed-class label**, not a dynamic framework  
- This map is not designed to induce orientation, inference, or discovery  
- **Predictive or metaphorical readings are explicitly disallowed**

> All Series entries are structurally static.  
> They must not be extrapolated, generalized, or reclassified.
