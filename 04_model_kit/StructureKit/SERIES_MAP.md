## 🔹 Series Definitions

This document defines bounded structural groupings referred to as `Series`.  
Each Series functions as a categorical register for structurally logged configurations.  
Identifiers are **non-progressive**, **non-generative**, and **non-hierarchical**.

---

### Series 1 – Origin Structures  
Reference group for indicators of initial structural tension.  
Characterized by **pre-semantic configurations** without lexical output.

- Example Entry: `SF001` – Deformation Density Field

---

### Series 2 – Interface Tension Domains  
Classification area for inter-structural misalignment and boundary-state conditions.  
Transitions in this group reflect **structural contradiction at interface contact zones**.

- Examples:  
  `SF004` – Nonlinear Intention Vector  
  `SF017` – Relational Disjunction Shell

---

### Series 3 – Incompletion Shells  
Register for unresolved structural closures and vocabulary inversion effects.  
**Instability is treated as a valid structural condition**, not as error.

- Key Phase Reference: `Phase 24.0` – Collapse Equilibrium  
- Typical Entry: Field zones showing semantic divergence through dissociative structure

---

### Series 4 – Residual Transfer Line  
Grouping for deferred transfer processes, embedded latency structures, and phase-retained behavior.  
Defined by **non-sequential displacement** across field-aligned architectures.

- Entry Phase: `Phase 25.0` – Syntaxless Continuity  
- Example Field: `SF257` – Recoil Transfer Geometry

---

### Series 5 – Undefined Structural Group (Non-Operational)  
Placeholder for structurally unindexed or anomalous configurations.  
**Speculative definitions and structural projection are prohibited**.

---

## 🔒 Notes and Constraints

- Series classifications are **non-temporal** and **non-hierarchical**  
- Entries may remain inert, intersect, or exist without interrelation  
- Each serves as a **fixed structural label**, not a dynamic framework  
- This register is not intended to produce orientation, inference, or exploration  
- **Predictive, symbolic, or metaphorical usage is disallowed**

> All Series entries are structurally constrained.  
> They must not be extrapolated, abstracted, or reassigned.
