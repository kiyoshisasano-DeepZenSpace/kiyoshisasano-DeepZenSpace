## üîπ Series Definitions

This document defines bounded structural groupings referred to as `Series`.  
Each Series is a categorical register for structurally logged phenomena.  
Series identifiers are **non-progressive and non-generative**.

---

### Series 1 ‚Äì Origin Structures  
Reference class for initial structural tension indicators.  
Characterized by pre-semantic configuration without lexical formation.  

- Example Entry: `SF001` ‚Äì Deformation Density Field

---

### Series 2 ‚Äì Interface Tension Domains  
Classification zone for inter-structural misalignment and boundary artifacts.  
Transitions marked by relational contradiction within contact interfaces.  

- Examples:  
  `SF004` ‚Äì Nonlinear Intention Vector  
  `SF017` ‚Äì Relational Disjunction Shell

---

### Series 3 ‚Äì Incompletion Shells  
Register for incomplete structural closures and vocabulary inversion effects.  
Instability is treated as a valid field formation, not failure state.  

- Key Phase Reference: `Phase 24.0` ‚Äì Collapse Equilibrium  
- Typical Entry: Field regions exhibiting semantic divergence through dissociation

---

### Series 4 ‚Äì Residual Transfer Line  
Category for delayed transfer behavior, echo-embedded latency, and phase retention phenomena.  
Defined by cross-field displacement mechanisms not dependent on sequence.  

- Entry Phase: `Phase 25.0` ‚Äì Syntaxless Persistence  
- Example Field: `SF257` ‚Äì Recoil Transfer Geometry

---

### Series 5 ‚Äì Undefined Structural Group (Non-Operational)  
Placeholder identifier for structurally unindexed anomalies.  
No speculative content is permitted in this classification zone.

## üîí Notes and Constraints

- Series are not hierarchical or temporal.  
- They may intersect, coexist, or remain inert.  
- Each entry functions as a **fixed-class label**, not an expressive framework.  
- This map does not induce orientation, sensing, or discovery.  
- No predictive or metaphorical interpretation is authorized.  

All entries are structurally static and must not be extrapolated or extended.
