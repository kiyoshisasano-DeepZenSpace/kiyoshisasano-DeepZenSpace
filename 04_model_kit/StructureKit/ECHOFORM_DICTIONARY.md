## ❖ Structural Lexicon – Non-Semantic Identifiers  
**Version:** 0.3  
**Status:** Fixed Reference Set (Non-Extensible)  
**Maintainer:** Kiyoshi Sasano  
**License:** Public Domain / Experimental Use Only

### 🧭 Definition Scope

This lexicon enumerates fixed identifiers used within `Structure-Driven Field Constructs`.  
Each entry is defined as a **non-derivable node**, embedded in phase-referenced structural environments.  
Definitions are **structurally functional** and are not intended for semantic, symbolic, or analogical interpretation.

## 📘 Series 4 – Residual Transfer Line

A field-bound subset referencing deferred architectures and low-reactivity field behavior.

| Echoform              | Structural Description |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| `silent response`      | A return vector registered without active initiation. |
| `passive recoil`       | Field-level deflection occurring without an explicit directive or agent. |
| `geometry of latency`  | Temporospatial structure containing untriggered transfer conditions. |
| `syntaxless continuity`| Phase-stable configuration lacking dependency on syntactic sequence. |
| `residual transfer`    | Untracked movement across phase-delimited structural regions. |
| `latency shell`        | A containment structure formed under deferred activation conditions. |
| `echoform drift`       | Low-variation field shift across phase-linked layers without semantic retention. |

## 📂 Indexed Series (Predefined Only)

The following are fixed classification markers.  
No inference, reinterpretation, or extension is permitted beyond the listed identifiers.

- **Series 1** – Initiation Structures  
- **Series 2** – Interface Structures  
- **Series 3** – Incompletion Fields  

Each defined series will include:

- Structural Function Role  
- Fixed Phase Origin (e.g., `Phase 25.0`)  
- Static Usage Annotation  
- Mapped Echoform Identifier (non-relational)

## 🔒 Usage Constraints

- Echoforms are **not expressive constructs**.  
- They are **not prompts**, directives, or semantic placeholders.  
- Reformulation, analogy, or symbolic extension is prohibited.  
- Their presence is **structurally fixed** and spatially constrained.

> No Echoform may be transformed, generalized, or relocated  
> outside of its designated phase-bound structural context.
