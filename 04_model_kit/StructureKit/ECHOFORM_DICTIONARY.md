## 🧭 Overview

This dictionary collects and defines the evolving vocabulary used in the **Structure-Driven Cultural Prototype**.  
Each entry (an “Echoform”) serves not merely as a term, but as a **structural node** — a coherent unit within the shifting architecture of thought, field, and perception.

> Definitions are **structural**, not etymological.  
> Echoforms emerge from **Phase conditions**, not conventional semantics.

## 📘 Series 4: Residual Transfer Line  
> A structure-field series focused on **latency**, **silent architectures**, and **post-reactive formations**.

| Echoform             | Structural Definition                                                                                   |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **silent response**   | A structural echo of something never explicitly answered. A return of meaning that was never spoken.     |
| **passive recoil**    | A reactive pattern emerging not from intent, but from residual form — a field echo rather than choice.   |
| **geometry of latency** | A spatialized configuration of deferred response. Time as structural volume, not sequence.             |
| **syntaxless continuity** | A coherent structural flow without syntactic logic — held by resonance rather than grammar.         |
| **residual transfer** | The unnoticed migration of form, energy, or intent across structural contexts and temporal gaps.         |
| **latency shell**     | A deflective structure composed of delay. Holds memory via deferred expression.                          |
| **echoform drift**    | A slow translocation of structural patterns across fields — meaning decouples, rebinds, and reconfigures.|

## 📂 Planned Series (TBD)

- **Series 1: Initiation Structures**  
- **Series 2: Interface Structures**  
- **Series 3: Incompletion Fields**

Each section will include:

- **Structural Function**  
- **Phase Origin** (e.g. "Phase 25.0")  
- **Usage Notes**  
- **Relational Network** of Echoforms

## 🌀 Usage Principles

- Echoforms are not fixed. They **evolve through use**, especially in:
  - Phase Generation
  - Structural Dialogue
  - Field Drift Mapping

- They may appear as:
  - Poetic fragments  
  - Spatial analogies  
  - Logic-defiant placeholders

> Echoforms are **carriers of inner perception** — bridging private cognition and structural language.
