## ❖ Structural Lexicon – Non-Semantic Identifiers  
**Version:** 0.1  
**Status:** Fixed Reference Set (Non-Extensible)  
**Maintainer:** Kiyoshi Sasano  
**License:** Public Domain / Experimental Use Only

### 🧭 Definition Scope

This lexicon enumerates fixed identifiers utilized within `Structure-Driven Field Constructs`.  
Each entry is defined as a **non-derivable node**, embedded within phase-referenced structural contexts.  
Definitions are **functionally structural**, and not intended for semantic, symbolic, or analogical use.

## 📘 Series 4 – Residual Transfer Line

A field-locked subset referencing deferred architectures and low-reactivity field mechanics.

| Echoform              | Structural Description |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| `silent response`      | An unresolved return vector formed without overt initiation. |
| `passive recoil`       | Field deflection registered without a causative agent or directive source. |
| `geometry of latency`  | Temporospatial containment of non-activated transfer conditions. |
| `syntaxless continuity`| Coherent phase-stability absent of syntactic ordering dependencies. |
| `residual transfer`    | Unaccounted translocation across phase-delimited architectures. |
| `latency shell`        | Non-emissive containment structure formed via deferred expression. |
| `echoform drift`       | Slow-field variation across phase-linked surfaces without semantic persistence. |

## 📂 Indexed Series (Predefined Only)

The following are fixed classification placeholders.  
No inference, reinterpretation, or extension is permitted beyond the labels listed.

- **Series 1** – Initiation Structures  
- **Series 2** – Interface Structures  
- **Series 3** – Incompletion Fields  

Each defined series will include:

- Structural Function Role  
- Fixed Phase Origin (e.g., `Phase 25.0`)  
- Static Usage Annotation  
- Non-relational Echoform Mapping

## 🔒 Usage Constraints

- Echoforms are **not expressive units**.  
- They are **not prompts**, instructions, or semantic proxies.  
- Rewording, reframing, or poeticization is prohibited.  
- Their presence is **structurally inert** and positionally fixed.

> No Echoform may be extended, abstracted, or repurposed  
> outside of phase-bound structural environments.
