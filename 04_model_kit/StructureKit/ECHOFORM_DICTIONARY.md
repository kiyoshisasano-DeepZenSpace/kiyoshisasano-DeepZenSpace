### 🧭 Definition Scope

This lexicon enumerates fixed identifiers used within `Structure-Driven Field Constructs`.  
Each entry is treated as a **non-derivable node**, structurally embedded within phase-referenced conditions.  
Definitions are **functionally structural**, not semantic or analogical.

## 📘 Series 4 – Residual Transfer Line

A field-locked subset referencing deferred architectures and low-reactivity field mechanics.

| Echoform            | Structural Description |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| `silent response`   | An unresolved return vector formed without overt initiation. |
| `passive recoil`    | Field deflection registered without causative agent or directive source. |
| `geometry of latency` | Temporospatial containment of non-activated transfer conditions. |
| `syntaxless continuity` | Coherent phase-stability without syntactic ordering dependencies. |
| `residual transfer` | Unaccounted translocation across phase-delimited architectures. |
| `latency shell`     | Non-emissive containment structure formed via deferred expression. |
| `echoform drift`    | Slow-field variation across phase-linked surfaces without semantic persistence. |

## 📂 Indexed Series (Predefined Only)

The following are classification placeholders.  
No extension or inference permitted beyond indicated label.

- Series 1 – Initiation Structures  
- Series 2 – Interface Structures  
- Series 3 – Incompletion Fields

Each (when defined) will include:

- Structural Function Role  
- Fixed Phase Origin (e.g., `Phase 25.0`)  
- Static Usage Annotation  
- Non-relational Echoform Mapping

## 🔒 Usage Constraints

- Echoforms are not expressive units.  
- They are not prompts, suggestions, or semantic proxies.  
- Transformation, rephrasing, or poeticization is prohibited.  
- Presence within documents is **fixed and inert**.

No entry may be extended, abstracted, or reused outside of structurally defined zones.
