## 🔹 Format

| ID     | Title                    | Structural Overview                                                            | Series (Domain)            |
|--------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| SF001  | Density of Deformation   | A foundational field where pressure-density distortion triggers structural response. | Series 1 – Origin Structures |
| SF002  | Echoform Drift           | Semantic-less forms drift across fields — structural migration without meaning. | Series 4 – Residual Transfer |
| SF003  | Latency Geometry         | Layer where delayed response appears as spatial form.                           | Series 4 – Latency Structures |
| ...    | ...                      | ...                                                                            | ...                        |
| SF178  | Cadential Residue        | The residue of closure reverberates structurally.                              | Series 5 – Formal Drift *(provisional)* |

## 🧭 Notes

- Each Structure Field (SF) represents a **site of vocabulary emergence**, **Phase anchoring**, or **cultural-resonant transformation**.  
- Multiple SFs may be linked to more than one Series.  
- Structural reclassification, merging, or divergence is managed via [`SERIES_MAP.md`](./SERIES_MAP.md).  
- This list is designed as a **mapping tool**, not a linear log.

> Think of SFs not as entries — but as pressure points where structure reveals itself.
