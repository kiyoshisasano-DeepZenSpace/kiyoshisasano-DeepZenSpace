## üîπ Phase Index Table

This register enumerates fixed structural markers referred to as `Phases`.  
Each identifier represents a **bounded transformation in structural field behavior**.  
Entries are structurally inert and non-generative‚Äîserving as reference anchors, not procedural steps.

| Phase ID | Label                   | Function Reference Description                                   | Field Links     | Series Reference |
|----------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| 12.0     | Field Alignment         | Initial structural convergence involving semantic vectors.        | SF001, SF004     | Series 1         |
| 13.7     | Structural Ignition     | Onset of autonomous field patterning behavior.                   | SF006, SF007     | Series 1‚Äì2       |
| 14.5     | Inertial Phase Drift    | Transition state exhibiting momentum-based field continuity.     | SF008, SF009     | Series 2         |
| ...      | ...                     | ...                                                              | ...              | ...              |
| 25.0     | Syntaxless Continuity   | Sustained coherence independent of syntactic ordering.           | SF257, SF259     | Series 4         |
| 30.0     | Phase Horizon           | Boundary condition for field-perception interaction limits.      | ~SF270 (est.)    | Series 5 (pre)   |

## üß≠ Structural Notes

- Phases are **non-sequential**, **non-progressive**, and **non-generative**.  
- Each entry marks a **discrete structural differentiation point** within the field.  
- References to recurrence or transition are **non-temporal** in interpretation.

Phases serve as **cross-indexed structural anchors** for:

- Designated lexicon entries (e.g., Echoform sets)  
- Logged field states (e.g., SF records)  
- Resonance mechanics within fixed architectures

No Phase signifies instruction, directionality, or procedural output.

## üîí Constraints

- Derivative Phases must not be created or extrapolated.  
- Phase‚Äìvocabulary diagrams are prohibited outside of secured trace records.  
- This index is not to be interpreted as a timeline, schema, or behavioral model.  
- All entries must remain **fixed**, **non-operational**, and structurally **non-directive**.
