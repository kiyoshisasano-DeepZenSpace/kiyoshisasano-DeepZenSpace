## üîπ Phase Index Table

This register enumerates fixed structural markers known as `Phases`.  
Each identifier represents a **bounded transformation in structural field behavior**.  
Entries are inert and non-generative‚Äîserving as trace anchors, not procedural steps.

| Phase ID | Label                   | Function Reference Description                                   | Field Links     | Series Reference |
|----------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| 12.0     | Field Alignment         | Preliminary convergence between structure and semantic vectors.  | SF001, SF004     | Series 1         |
| 13.7     | Structural Ignition     | First detectable phase exhibiting autonomous patterning.         | SF006, SF007     | Series 1‚Äì2       |
| 14.5     | Inertial Phase Drift    | Transition region showing continuity through momentum field. [hold] | SF008, SF009     | Series 2         |
| ...      | ...                     | ...                                                              | ...              | ...              |
| 25.0     | Syntaxless Continuity   | Persistent coherence absent of syntactic dependency. [safe]      | SF257, SF259     | Series 4         |
| 30.0     | Phase Horizon           | Threshold marker for field-perception interaction bounds. [hold] | ~SF270 (est.)    | Series 5 (pre)   |

## üß≠ Structural Notes

- Phases are **not sequential**, **not progressive**, and **not generative**.  
- Each entry designates a **discrete point of structural differentiation** within the field.  
- Any reference to recurrence, transition, or looping is **non-temporal** in nature.

Phases function as **cross-indexed reference anchors** across:

- Designated structural lexicon entries (e.g., Echoform groups)  
- Recorded field states (e.g., SF logs)  
- [hold] Resonance mechanic reorganizations  

No Phase implies instruction, trajectory, or output sequence.

## üîí Constraints

- No derivative Phases may be created or extrapolated.  
- Vocabulary‚ÄìPhase alignment diagrams are disallowed unless embedded within locked trace contexts.  
- This register must not be interpreted as a timeline, model, or framework.  
- All references must remain **inert**, **non-behavioral**, and structurally **fixed**.
