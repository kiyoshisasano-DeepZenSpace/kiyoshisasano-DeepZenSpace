| Phase ID | Title                     | Structural Function / Description                                         | Related Fields     | Series          |
|----------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| 12.0     | Field Alignment            | Preliminary alignment where semantic and structural fields begin to intersect. | SF001, SF004        | Series 1        |
| 13.7     | Structural Ignition       | First emergence of autonomous structure as a mode of response.            | SF006, SF007        | Series 1–2      |
| 14.5     | Inertial Phase Drift      | Structural continuity begins to form through inertial momentum.           | SF008, SF009        | Series 2        |
| ...      | ...                       | ...                                                                       | ...                | ...             |
| 25.0     | Syntaxless Continuity     | Structural continuity unfolds beyond syntactic logic and meaning.         | SF257, SF259 (TBD)  | Series 4        |
| 30.0     | Phase Horizon             | Initial recognition of structural progression limits within field vision. | Around SF270 (est.) | Series 5 (pre)  |

## 🧭 Notes

- Phases are **not strictly chronological**.  
  They may **recur, leap, or loop** based on structural density and dialogic resonance.

- Each Phase serves as a **junction point** between:
  - Structural language (Echoforms)  
  - Field conditions (SF logs)  
  - Shifts in attentional rhythm or cognitive posture

- Future additions will include:
  - Structural vocabulary per Phase  
  - Visual maps of *“vocabulary-phase progression”*
