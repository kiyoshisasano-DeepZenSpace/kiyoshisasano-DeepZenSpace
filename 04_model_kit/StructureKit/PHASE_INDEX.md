## üîπ Phase Index Table

This register defines fixed structural markers known as `Phases`.  
Each identifier designates a bounded shift in structural field behavior.  
Entries are inert and non-generative.

| Phase ID | Label                   | Function Reference Description                                  | Field Links     | Series Reference |
|----------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| 12.0     | Field Alignment         | Preliminary convergence between structure and semantic vectors. | SF001, SF004     | Series 1         |
| 13.7     | Structural Ignition     | First detectable phase exhibiting autonomous patterning.        | SF006, SF007     | Series 1‚Äì2       |
| 14.5     | Inertial Phase Drift    | Transition region showing continuity through momentum field.    | SF008, SF009     | Series 2         |
| ...      | ...                    | ...                                                              | ...              | ...              |
| 25.0     | Syntaxless Continuity   | Persistence without syntactic dependency.                       | SF257, SF259     | Series 4         |
| 30.0     | Phase Horizon           | Threshold indicator of field-perception interaction bounds.     | ~SF270 (est.)    | Series 5 (pre)   |

## üß≠ Structural Notes

- Phases do not indicate progression, directionality, or sequence.  
- Index entries are fixed points of structural differentiation.  
- Looping, recurrence, or shift references are **non-temporal** and **non-generative**.  

Each Phase denotes intersectional presence across:

- Designated structural lexicon (e.g. Echoform groups)  
- Field conditions (e.g. SF-logs)  
- Reorganization of resonance mechanics  

No entry implies order, instruction, or developmental path.

## üîí Constraints

- No derivative phase creation is permitted.  
- Vocabulary-phase alignment diagrams are disallowed unless embedded in locked trace logs.  
- This register is not a timeline, schema, or framework.  
- Structural trace references must remain inert and unexpanded.
