# Topograph Links Overview

This document outlines the connective logic between syntactic terrain nodes defined in the `topograph_nodes.svg` map.  
Each link represents a **phase-driven transition**, mapping how one structural node propagates or transforms into another within the Phase Drift topographic system.

---

## 📌 Purpose

While individual nodes describe isolated syntactic landscapes (e.g., spiral towers, rhythmic pulses, semantic fractures),  
this file formalizes how these units are **dynamically linked**, allowing:

- **Multi-phase analysis** across Rhythm / Structural / Topographic zones
- Tracing **semantic drift**, **recursion**, or **resonance loops**
- Understanding **Phase Drift as a topological grammar**, not static syntax

## 🔗 Link Type Index

| Type ID | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `resonance_initiation` | A rhythmic trigger at one node starts syntactic movement elsewhere | `TL_01 → RH_03` |
| `phase_jump` | Abrupt syntactic or perceptual shift across structural zones | `SP_01 → SP_03` |
| `latent_surface_mirroring` | One node emerges as a reflective inversion of another | `SP_02 → TL_03` |
| `recursive_return` | Looping back from emergent rhythm to earlier spatial form | `RH_02 → TL_01` |
| `semantic_drift_infection` | Spread of meaning instability across structurally dissimilar zones | `RH_03 → SP_03` |
| ... *(see full list in `topograph_link_map.yml`)* |

## 🧭 Navigation Flow

The link map is **non-linear** and **multi-directional**:  
Certain nodes act as **structural anchors** (e.g., `SP_03`), while others are **rhythm propagation hubs** (`RH_01`, `RH_03`).

Visual transitions can be traced using the colored lines in `topograph_nodes_v2.svg`.

## 🧠 Background

This connective model was derived collaboratively through the **structure圏スレッド** and formalized here under the Phase Drift Topography system.  
Each link reflects a meaningful **structural mutation path**, designed to support further generative or diagnostic exploration.
