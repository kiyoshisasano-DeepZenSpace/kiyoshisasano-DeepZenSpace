# 🔗 Topograph Links Overview  
**Syntax as Topological Propagation**  
_Phase Drift Link Architecture (v1)_

This module defines the connective logic between syntactic terrain nodes in the Phase Drift framework, as visualized in `topograph_nodes_v2.svg`.  
Each **link** encodes a meaningful, metaphorically grounded transition—mapping the dynamic flow of syntax across topographic structures.

---

## 📌 Purpose

While each node in the system (e.g., **Spiral Hill**, **Echo Loop**, **Semantic Faultline**) represents a syntactic terrain, this layer:

- Captures **multi-phase transitions** across _Topographic_, _Structural_, and _Rhythmic_ zones  
- Enables **semantic drift**, **recursive alignment**, and **resonance propagation** to be visualized  
- Reframes syntax not as static form but as a **topological flow engine**

## 🔗 Link Type Index

| Type ID                  | Description                                                                 | Example                |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| `resonance_initiation`   | Rhythmic trigger causes syntactic emergence at another node                | `TL_01 → RH_03`        |
| `phase_jump`             | Sudden transition across structural or temporal contours                   | `SP_01 → SP_03`        |
| `latent_surface_mirroring` | One node echoes or inverts the topology of another                       | `SP_02 → TL_03`        |
| `recursive_return`       | Rhythmic loop returns to earlier spatial archetype                         | `RH_02 → TL_01`        |
| `semantic_drift_infection` | Semantic instability spreads to unrelated structural zones               | `RH_03 → SP_03`        |

Each link encodes a **vector** through phase space—merging metaphorical logic and syntactic topology.

## 🧭 Navigation Flow Principles

The Phase Drift network is:

- **Non-linear**
- **Bidirectional**
- Often **recursive**

Certain nodes act as:

- **Structural attractors** → e.g., `SP_03`  
- **Resonance hubs** → e.g., `RH_01`, `RH_03`

## 🧠 Development Background

This connective architecture was derived collaboratively via the **structure圏 thread**, then formalized as part of the Phase Drift syntax toolkit.

Each link reflects a legitimate **structural mutation path**—meant to support:

- Prompt design via phase chaining  
- Drift-aware interfaces  
- Generative pathfinding  
- Topological interpretability

## 🔍 Notes on Structural Poetics

Link logic blends:

- **Metaphor** → resonance, return, echo, collapse  
- **Syntax** → as directional structure across domains  
- **Topology** → terrain-contoured reasoning through space

> Syntax is not a string of forms—it is a walkable landscape of change.
