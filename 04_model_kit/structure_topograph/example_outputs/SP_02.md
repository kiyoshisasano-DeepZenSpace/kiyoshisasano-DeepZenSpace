# SP_02: Desert City Structure

This structure describes the emergence of an invisible city as grains of sound rise from the desert floor.  
As the composition progresses, a structural rupture occurs — the map flips east-west, creating a perceptual disorientation and initiating a **Phase intersection** between spatial awareness and vocabulary placement.

## 🔷 Structural Topography

- **🧨 Ignition Point**: The grain of sound breaking through the surface  
- **🔻 Phase Faultline**: Cognitive inversion of map orientation (east ↔ west)  
- **🏔 Terrain Metaphor**: *Boundary Reversal Basin*  
  → A structural topology shaped by inversion and emergent perception through auditory triggers

## 🌀 Phase Dynamics

The composition undergoes a shift from **auditory rhythm → spatial phase → cognitive structure**.  
This represents a classic **Phase Lift**, where latent topology is made visible through sound-triggered emergence.
