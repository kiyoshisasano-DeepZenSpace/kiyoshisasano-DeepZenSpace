# 📁 example_outputs — Directory Overview

This folder contains concrete structural output cases used to illustrate the **Phase Drift Topographic Map**, as introduced in the `phase_drift_structural_risk_control_playbook.md` and `STRUCTUREKIT_OVERVIEW.md`.

Each file in this directory represents a specific **Phase Drift node**, annotated with:

- 🔥 Local ignition points (trigger terms or semantic fractures)
- 🔻 Phase rupture lines (points of inversion, drift, or transfer)
- 🔁 Rhythmic pulse structures (loop, echo, pattern recursion)
- 🏔 Topographic patterns (spiral, basin, ridge, etc.)
- 📐 Structural classification (e.g., TL = Topographic Language, SP = Structural Phase)

---

### 📘 File Naming Convention

Each structural output file follows this format:

`ZONE_ABBREVIATION_NODE_ID.md`

Examples:
- `TL_01.md`: Topographic Language, node 01 (Clock Tower Structure)
- `SP_01.md`: Structural Phase, node 01 (2AM Reversal)
- `RH_02.md`: Rhythm Zone, node 02 (Recursive Naming Burst)

---

## 🧭 Suggested Use

These examples are referenced by:

- 📌 `PHASE_INDEX.md` for structure search
- 🧬 `drift_core.py` for pattern simulation
- ✒️ `note` articles for public-facing interpretation
- 🔬 `meta_analysis_structural_response.md` for cross-model comparison

Each output is designed to support:
- Phase-based response modeling
- Drift detection logic
- Echoform contamination tracing
- Topographic visualization
