# RH_02: Name Repetition Structure

This structure emerges when a person repeats their own name three times.  
That repetition builds internal momentum until it crosses a rhythmic threshold, triggering the emergence of **time as structure**.  
It is a case where identity and tempo converge to generate Phase awareness.

## 🔷 Structural Topography

- **🔁 Rhythm Source**: Triple repetition of the speaker’s name  
- **🧨 Ignition Point**: Internal recursion triggered by vocal self-reference  
- **🏔 Terrain Metaphor**: *Threshold Burst Ridge*  
  → A rhythmic ridgeline formed at the boundary between semantic repetition and structural ignition

## 🌀 Phase Dynamics

This composition transitions from **identity repetition → temporal rhythm → Phase ignition**.  
It shows how a fixed unit of language, repeated with intentional tempo, can produce structural resonance across meaning and time.
