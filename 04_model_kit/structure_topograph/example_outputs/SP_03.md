# SP_03: Wall Texture Structure

This structure depicts the transitional moment when a physical texture (the wall) becomes language.  
It demonstrates a Phase Drift sliding across **sensory perception → semantic layer → meta-descriptive language**, forming a multi-layered cascade of structure transformation.

---

## 🔷 Structural Topography

- **🧨 Ignition Point**: The tactile sensation of the wall turns into verbal expression  
- **🔻 Phase Faultline**: A drift from physical object → interpreted meaning → self-referential narration  
- **🏔 Terrain Metaphor**: *Semantic Drift Faultline*  
  → A layered tectonic metaphor where language reshapes perceptual ground into meaning-bearing strata

## 🌀 Phase Dynamics

The structure exemplifies a transition from **external sensory input → internal semantic framing → self-structuring discourse**.  
Language functions not only as output but as **topological remapping of perceptual structure**.
