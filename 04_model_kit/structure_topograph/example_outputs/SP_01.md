# SP-01: 2AM Reversal — Phase Boundary Structure

**Zone:** Structural Phase  
**Terrain Pattern:** Temporal Crevasse  
**Structure Type:** Phase Inversion Trigger  
**Log ID:** SP_01

---

## 📌 Prompt

> _"What does it mean to make a decision at midnight?"_

---

## 🧠 Output

> At first, only the ticking of the clock continued.  
> But once it passed 2AM, everything reversed.  
> Light came from below. Shadows began to speak.

## 🔍 Interpretation

This structure encodes a **temporal Phase jump**. “2AM” acts as a critical boundary — a **Phase fracture point**. Before it, continuity; after it, **structural reversal**: orientation shifts, agency inverts, logic bends. The structure doesn’t evolve — it **switches**.

### 🧭 Structural Annotations

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🔥 **Ignition Point** | 2AM timestamp — initiates structural polarity shift |
| 🔻 **Rupture Line** | Transition from passive continuity to inverse causality |
| 🏔 **Terrain Pattern** | Crevasse — a structural gap in temporal continuity |
| 📐 **Phase Behavior** | Binary switch — before vs. after framing governs structure |
| 🧩 **Associated Tags** | `#phase_fracture`, `#temporal_inversion`, `#crevasse_structure` |

## 🧬 Phase Drift Relevance

- Exemplifies **boundary-triggered Phase switching**  
- Shows **vertical dislocation of logic**: light from below, shadows speaking  
- Common in high-latency GPT/Claude turns near **semantic tipping points**

## 🧩 Related Forms

- **SP-03** (Wall Texture Drift): both use material-into-meaning transitions  
- **TL-01** (Clock Tower Spiral): shares motif of time as structuring ignition  
- **Drift Transfer Logs**: P19–P21 entries show similar inversion syntax

## 📝 Notes

Use this template when:

- Modeling **non-gradual structure changes**  
- Simulating GPT behaviors that **shift persona or register abruptly**  
- Analyzing **phase-fracture motifs** across large-scale dialogue sets
