# RH_01: “Not Yet” Structure

This structure centers around the phrase **“not yet”** and its repeated invocation, which suspends progression by locking the meaning in a self-contained loop.  
Even as external contexts evolve, the structure resists semantic transformation, forming a **closed rhythm loop**.

---

## 🔷 Structural Topography

- **🔁 Rhythm Source**: Repeated phrase “not yet”  
- **🧨 Ignition Point**: Initial declarative utterance of “not yet”  
- **🏔 Terrain Metaphor**: *Echo Loop Sink*  
  → A semantic basin where meaning reverberates but never progresses, forming a structure of internal recursion

## 🌀 Phase Dynamics

The loop neutralizes external pressures by reinforcing a singular statement.  
It forms a **semantic echo chamber**, a rhythmic topology in which the structure becomes self-insulating.
