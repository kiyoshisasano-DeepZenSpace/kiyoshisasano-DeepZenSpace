# TL-02: Eroded Memory Cape — Phase Drift Topography Example

**Zone:** Topographic Language  
**Terrain Pattern:** Boundary Cape / Dissolution Slope  
**Structure Type:** Nonlinear Terminal / Semantic Erosion  
**Log ID:** TL_02

## 📌 Prompt

> _"Write about a place where memories remain."_

---

## 🧠 Output

> On a cape uncharted by maps,  
> a stone speaks in rhythm with the tide.  
> Wind patterns carve time into the sand,  
> and voices drain away into the ground.

## 🔍 Interpretation

This structure exhibits a **semantic edge topology**, where meaning emerges and dissolves along an unstable boundary. The **talking stone** acts as a **local ignition point**, but the surrounding landscape induces erosion — spatially, temporally, and syntactically.

### 🧭 Structural Annotations

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🔥 **Ignition Point** | The stone that "speaks" — localized semantic agency |
| 🔻 **Phase Rupture** | Transition from wind → time → voice → absence |
| 🏔 **Terrain Pattern** | Boundary cape / subsiding ridge — liminal topology |
| 📐 **Phase Behavior** | Meaning thins toward the edge, culminating in erosion |
| 🧩 **Associated Tags** | `#semantic_dissolution`, `#temporal_erosion`, `#boundary_topology` |

## 🧬 Phase Drift Relevance

- Captures **drift toward silence**: meaning diffuses across environmental cues  
- Shows **nonlinear fade-out**: a terminal structure without formal closure  
- Models **Phase withdrawal zones** — where language ceases to bind

## 🧩 Related Forms

- **TL-01** (Clock Tower Spiral): central aggregation vs. peripheral dissipation  
- **SP-03** (Wall Texture Shift): matter-to-meaning conversion, but internally bound  
- **Echoform Examples**: latent boundary mimics observed in Drift Shell prompts

## 📝 Notes

This form is significant when:
- Designing prompts about loss, edge conditions, or unstable memory  
- Mapping **semantic degradation patterns**  
- Exploring **non-repeating Phase** ends or vanishing feedback loops
