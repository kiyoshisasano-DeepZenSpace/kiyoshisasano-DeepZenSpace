## Phase Drift Structural Topography Map (v1)

This module provides a topographic interpretation of syntactic phenomena observed in Phase Drift structures. It translates emergent syntactic forms‚Äîsuch as rhythmic loops, phase inversions, and drift-based mutations‚Äîinto **spatial terrains** and **structural maps**, making structural changes visible and traceable across instances.

## üîç Key Structural Zones

### 1. Topographic Language Zone
Structures shaped like landscapes: hills, valleys, spirals, or grids. Syntactic meaning is encoded in spatial depth and stratification.

- **TL-01**: Spiral Core around a Clock Tower
- **TL-02**: Eroded Memory Cape
- **TL-03**: Gridded Urban Silence

### 2. Structural Phase Zone
Sentences driven by abrupt **phase shifts**, reversals, or discontinuities. Syntax behaves like fault lines.

- **SP-01**: 2AM Inversion Crevasse
- **SP-02**: Sound-Emerged Desert Map
- **SP-03**: Texture-to-Language Phase Jump

### 3. Rhythm Zone
Repeating syntactic forms that generate **pulses, interference, and waveforms**‚Äîlanguage as a resonance field.

- **RH-01**: Static Loop ("Not yet.")
- **RH-02**: Triple Repetition Threshold
- **RH-03**: Knock-Triggered Room Ripple

## üß≠ Structural Tags and Components

Each structural unit includes:

- `ignition`: point of syntactic initiation
- `rupture`: transition line / phase break
- `pattern`: spatial or rhythmic form
- `terrain`: metaphorical shape (e.g., spiral hill, fault basin)
- `phase_zone`: Topographic / Structural Phase / Rhythm

These are specified in `terrain_map.yaml` and visualized in `structure_topograph.svg`.

---

## üß© Applications

- **Cross-model structure comparison**
- **Phase chain tracking and recurrence analysis**
- **Drift-sensitive prompt design**
- **Syntax as terrain-based interface**

---

## üìÇ File Overview

- `terrain_map.yaml`: YAML-based syntactic terrain index
- `structure_topograph.svg`: SVG map visualizing structures
- `example_outputs/`: Markdown logs of prompt-structure-output chains
- `phase_node_coords.json`: JSON for mapping syntax to coordinates

### üìå Topograph Link Map

The updated structural map includes **10 inter-node link lines** based on:
- Phase jump
- Rhythmic escalation
- Semantic drift
- Recursive resonance

Each line is colored and labeled by its connection type.  
See `topograph_nodes_v2.svg` and `topograph_link_map.yml` for details.
