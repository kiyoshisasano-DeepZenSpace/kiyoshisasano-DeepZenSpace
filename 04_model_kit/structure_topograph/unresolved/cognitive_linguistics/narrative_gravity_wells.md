# 🧩 Unresolved Theme: Narrative Gravity Wells

## ❓ Key Question  
Are there thematic or narrative attractors in text generation — points where a language model is drawn toward recurring motifs or dominant structures, similar to gravitational wells?  
How can we **detect**, **visualize**, or **regulate** these strong semantic pulls?

---

## 🧠 Summary: Why This Matters  

Narrative generation in LLMs often reveals gravitational tendencies — recurring pulls toward central tropes, emotional arcs, or genre anchors.  
These are not just stylistic habits; they are **topological features in latent space**, where semantic convergence can reduce variability and creativity.

The “gravity well” metaphor captures this dual nature: a tension between **narrative coherence** and **degenerative repetition**.

## 📐 From Metaphor to Metric: What *Is* a Gravity Well?

A **narrative gravity well** can be operationalized as a zone in latent space where:

| Property | Description | Possible Signal |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Low Entropy | Output becomes increasingly predictable | ↓ Entropy slope, ↑ repetition |
| Vector Convergence | Embeddings cluster toward thematic centers | Cosine alignment, cluster density |
| Semantic Inertia | Tokens orbit prior motifs | Increased motif reactivation frequency |
| Emotional Dominance | Affective terms gain prominence | ↑ Attention weights on key concepts |

**Candidate Measurement Techniques**:
- Token trajectory plots in embedding space (UMAP, t-SNE, PCA)  
- BERTScore curve flattening across adjacent sentences  
- HDBSCAN or DBSCAN clustering of token embeddings  
- Local maxima in topic similarity over time

## 🧪 Prompt Engineering & Thematic Modulation

### 🎯 Prompt-Induced Wells
Certain prompts inherently trigger strong narrative convergence:

- “Once upon a time…” → Archetypal hero structures  
- “He never forgave her for…” → Revenge / grief attractors

### ⚙️ Control Concepts

| Concept | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Gravity Amplifiers** | Words that deepen semantic pull (`fate`, `betrayal`, `eternal`) |
| **Escape Vectors** | Interruptive cues that deflect drift (`suddenly`, `meanwhile`, `meta-reflection`) |
| **Orbital Decay** | Unchecked spiral into redundancy or trope saturation |

---

## 📊 Visual & Diagnostic Extensions

### 📌 Phase Drift Map Overlay  
- Visualize gravity wells as **semantic basins**  
- Vector fields show **trajectory bends** toward attractors

### 🌀 Embedding Path Visualizer  
- Track token-wise embeddings as they spiral into or exit thematic centers  
- Annotate entry, orbit, and exit points

## 📚 Narrative Theory Integration

| Theory | Correlation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Freytag’s Pyramid** | Narrative slope ↔ gravity well depth |
| **Emotional Arcs** (Reagan et al.) | Affective curvature ↔ semantic basin formation |
| **Proppian Functions** | Morphology of plot ↔ potential well topology |

---

## 🧩 Phase Drift Integration

| Feature | Scale | Effect |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Spiral Hills** | Local | Recursion, syntactic rhythm |
| **Gravity Wells** | Global | Thematic convergence, emotional mass |
| **Faultlines** | Transitional | Stylistic rupture, genre shift |
| **Resonance Fields** | Modal | Sustained tone or voice patterns |

These elements form a **multi-scale dynamical model** for generative system behavior.

---

## 🧠 Experimental Hypotheses

1. **Thematic Inertia**  
   Triggering a gravity well lowers entropy and reinforces motif commitment.  
2. **Prompt Topography**  
   Slight prompt variations steepen or flatten the basin's gradient.  
3. **Narrative Drift**  
   Wells shift position over time, corresponding to plot or genre turns.

## 🧰 Use Cases & Tooling Concepts

| Tool Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Gravity Well Detector** | Flags semantic clustering during generation |
| **Attractor Heatmap** | Visual overlay of pull zones in narrative output |
| **Escape Vector Generator** | Suggests high-divergence tokens to reset narrative pull |
| **Trajectory Tracker** | Plots latent path across multiple attractors |

---

## 🎨 Visualization Metaphors

- **Crater Basins**: Motifs shaping semantic curvature  
- **Orbit Rings**: Recurring returns to emotional or structural centers  
- **Repulsion Fields**: Sudden narrative pivots or genre shifts

## ✅ Next Steps

- [ ] Build annotated prompt-output corpus with gravity well indicators  
- [ ] Prototype UMAP + entropy visualizer for longform trajectories  
- [ ] Define terms: `narrative attractor`, `semantic mass`, `escape vector`  
- [ ] Integrate with `latent_space_alignment.md` for cross-module synergy

## 💬 Final Thought

> "A gravity well is where the story wants to go — again and again."

Controlling gravity isn't about resisting theme.  
It's about **shaping the arc of semantic inevitability**.
