# 🧩 Unresolved Theme: Narrative Gravity Wells

## ❓ Key Question  
Are there thematic or narrative attractors in text generation—points where a language model is drawn toward recurring motifs or dominant structures, similar to gravitational wells? How can we **detect**, **visualize**, or **regulate** these strong semantic pulls?

---

## 🧠 Summary: Why This Matters  
Narrative generation in LLMs often shows signs of gravitational pull—tendencies toward central tropes, emotional arcs, or genre anchors. These aren't just stylistic habits—they’re **topological features of latent space**, where semantic convergence reduces variability and creativity.  

The “gravity well” metaphor captures this dual nature: **narrative coherence** vs. **degenerative repetition**.

## 📐 From Metaphor to Metric: What *Is* a Gravity Well?

A **narrative gravity well** can be operationalized as a zone in latent space where:

| Property | Description | Possible Signal |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Low Entropy | Model output becomes increasingly predictable | ↓ Entropy slope, ↑ repetition |
| Vector Convergence | Embeddings trend toward thematic centers | Cosine alignment, cluster density |
| Semantic Inertia | Tokens "orbit" prior motifs | Increased return-to-motif frequency |
| Emotional Dominance | Salient affective terms gain momentum | ↑ Attention weights on key concepts |

**Candidate Measurement Techniques**:
- Token trajectory plots in embedding space (via UMAP, t-SNE, PCA)
- BERTScore curve flattening across sentences
- HDBSCAN or DBSCAN clustering of semantic vectors
- Local maxima in topic similarity over time

## 🧪 Prompt Engineering & Thematic Modulation

### 🎯 Prompt-Induced Wells
Certain prompts inherently deepen gravity wells:
- “Once upon a time…” → Archetypal hero structures
- “He never forgave her for…” → Revenge / grief wells

### ⚙️ Control Concepts
| Concept | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Gravity Amplifiers** | Words that intensify semantic pull (`fate`, `betrayal`, `eternal`) |
| **Escape Vectors** | Interruptive cues that deflect thematic drift (`suddenly`, `meanwhile`, `meta-reflection`) |
| **Orbital Decay** | Unwanted spiral toward redundancy or trope saturation |

---

## 📊 Visual & Diagnostic Extensions

### 📌 Phase Drift Map Overlay
- Visualize wells as **semantic basins**
- Vector arrows show **trajectory bend** around wells

### 🌀 Embedding Path Visualizer
- Track **token-wise embeddings** as they spiral into or escape thematic centers
- Annotate well entries and exits

## 📚 Narrative Theory Integration

| Theory | Correlation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Freytag’s Pyramid** | Narrative slope as gravity well depth |
| **Emotional Arcs** (Reagan et al.) | Curvature in affective space = gravity well structure |
| **Proppian Functions** | Morphology of story = potential well topographies |

---

## 🧩 Phase Drift Integration

| Feature | Scale | Effect |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Spiral Hills** | Local | Recursion, syntactic rhythm |
| **Gravity Wells** | Global | Thematic convergence, emotional mass |
| **Faultlines** | Transitional | Stylistic rupture or genre shift |
| **Resonance Fields** | Modal | Sustained tone or voice pattern |

Together, they form a **multi-scale dynamical system** for modeling LLM behavior.

---

## 🧠 Experimental Hypotheses

1. **Thematic Inertia**: Once a well is triggered, output entropy drops as the model "commits" to a motif.
2. **Prompt Topography**: Small wording changes can steepen or flatten well gradients.
3. **Narrative Drift**: Gravity wells migrate over long-form text, corresponding to genre shifts or plot turns.

## 🧰 Use Cases & Tooling Concepts

| Tool Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Gravity Well Detector** | Flags clustering in semantic space during generation |
| **Attractor Heatmap** | Color-coded overlay of gravitational pull across narrative |
| **Escape Vector Generator** | Suggests high-dispersion tokens to break trope collapse |
| **Trajectory Tracker** | Plots latent path of a story through multiple attractors |

---

## 🎨 Visualization Metaphors

- **Crater Basins**: Dominant motifs shaping global curvature
- **Orbit Rings**: Repeating returns to emotional or thematic centers
- **Repulsion Fields**: Abrupt topic changes or meta-narrative interventions

## ✅ Next Steps

- [ ] Build annotated prompt-output corpus tagged with gravity well features
- [ ] Prototype UMAP + entropy visualizer for longform text
- [ ] Define glossary for `narrative attractor`, `semantic mass`, `escape vector`
- [ ] Integrate with `latent_space_alignment.md` for topological synergy

## 💬 Final Thought

> "A gravity well is where the story wants to go—again and again."

Controlling gravity isn't about resisting theme—it's about **shaping the arc of semantic inevitability**.
