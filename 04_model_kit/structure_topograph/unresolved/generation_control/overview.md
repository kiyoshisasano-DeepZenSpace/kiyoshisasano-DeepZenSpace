🧬 Thread: Model Control and Structural Degradation Engineering
Status: Thread Root | Domain: Control Theory × Generative Linguistics | License: Non-Prescriptive | Tags: control_drift, stability_hooks, structural_repair

🧭 Overview
This thread investigates the interplay between generative control mechanisms and structural degradation dynamics in large language models (LLMs).
It extends the Phase Drift framework to model how systems may be guided, perturbed, or stabilized across complex syntactic and semantic terrains.

Where Phase Drift maps structure, this thread focuses on navigation, failure states, and realignment pathways.

🔍 Core Themes
Theme	Description
Phase-Aligned Control	Use of phase-space representations to influence model behavior
Controlled Phase Shifts	Intentional drift across syntactic or stylistic regimes
Degradation Detection	Early warning systems for incoherence, repetition, or collapse
Repair Scaffolds	Prompt fragments or latent signals used to restore structure
Field Alignment	Maintaining stylistic, tonal, or structural continuity

These topics intersect linguistic theory, reinforcement learning, interpretability, and creative tooling.

🧠 Application Contexts
Domain	Relevance
🧪 Interpretability	Diagnosing when, where, and why generation falters
🎛️ Control Systems	Steering LLMs via structural hooks and prompt grammars
✍️ Creative Generation	Introducing, modulating, or recovering stylized drift
🔐 Safety / RLHF	Preventing degenerative collapse or output instability
