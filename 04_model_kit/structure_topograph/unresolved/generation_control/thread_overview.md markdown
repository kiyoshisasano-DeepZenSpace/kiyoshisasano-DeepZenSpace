# ðŸ§¬ Thread: Model Control and Structural Degradation Engineering

## Overview
This thread examines the dynamics of control and collapse within AI language generation. It focuses on how large language models drift, fail, or can be steered using tools derived from the Phase Drift frameworkâ€”such as phase hooks, glitch detection, or decay monitoring.

## Core Topics
- Controlled phase transitions in generation
- Detection and repair of syntactic failures
- Prompt scaffolding and structural nudges
- Alignment of generation fields and style stability

## Intended Audience
Researchers in model interpretability, prompt engineering, reinforcement learning, and creative AI tooling.
