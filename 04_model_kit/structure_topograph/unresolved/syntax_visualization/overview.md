# ðŸ“Š Thread: AI-Guided Syntax Visualization and Navigation

## Overview
This thread focuses on the visual analysis and real-time monitoring of syntactic behavior in AI-generated language. Using the Phase Drift framework, it explores how models can become aware of their own structural paths, how syntax maps can guide generation, and how interfaces might be built for live navigation and diagnostics.

## Core Topics
- Syntactic phase detection and drift monitoring
- Structural trajectory logging
- Latent space alignment and real-time map overlays
- Human-in-the-loop syntax control

## Intended Audience
Researchers in AI interpretability, human-computer interaction (HCI), reinforcement learning for language, and visualization of generative models.
