# ðŸ§  Thread: Cognitive Syntax and Semantic Interference

## Overview
This thread explores how syntactic and semantic layers interact, diverge, or fail to bind properly in language generation. Within the Phase Drift framework, we examine how meaning shifts, echo distortions, or coherence breakdowns emerge from generative models, using perspectives from cognitive linguistics, semantics, and pragmatics.

## Core Topics
- Syntaxâ€“semantics binding failures
- Semantic drift and echo lensing
- Coherence loss and recovery
- Conceptual resonance and interference

## Intended Audience
Researchers and practitioners interested in cognitive semantics, generative syntax, discourse coherence, and evaluation of AI language output.
