# üß© Unresolved Theme: Narrative Gravity Wells

**Key Question**  
Are there thematic or narrative attractors in text generation‚Äîpoints where the language model is drawn toward recurring motifs or dominant structures, similar to gravitational wells? How can we detect, visualize, or regulate these strong semantic pulls?

**Description**  
During long-form or story-based generation, language models often gravitate toward certain narrative arcs, emotional tropes, or stylistic patterns. This behavior resembles a ‚Äúgravity well‚Äù: once a particular semantic center is introduced (e.g., a death, conflict, or love interest), the rest of the generation orbits this concept, sometimes at the expense of originality or coherence.

This theme investigates whether narrative attractors can be mathematically modeled, detected through embeddings or frequency clustering, or used deliberately to control narrative flow.

**Potential Subquestions**
- Can we identify common gravity wells across genres (e.g., detective tropes, hero's journey)?
- How can narrative gravity wells be used for controlled creativity vs. avoided to prevent degeneracy?
- Do certain prompts or phrasings deepen the gravity of a narrative attractor?

**Relevant Fields**
- Narratology (plot theory, thematic recurrence)  
- AI storytelling models  
- Cognitive semantics and emotional salience  
- Vector space analysis of thematic embeddings

**Relation to Phase Drift Framework**  
Narrative Gravity Wells extend the Phase Drift model by adding semantic topographic features with vector "pull"‚Äîregions of thematic gravity that influence syntactic structure. While the Spiral Hill metaphor focuses on recursion and rhythm, gravity wells model macro-scale influence across long sequences. These zones may explain why models repeatedly return to or cannot escape particular motifs.

**Visual Metaphor**  
On a Phase Drift map, a gravity well appears as a semantic depression‚Äîa deep basin or crater toward which text "falls." Surrounding regions show bending generative paths, repetitions, or intensifying emotional content.
