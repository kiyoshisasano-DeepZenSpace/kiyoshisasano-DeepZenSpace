# ðŸŽ¼ Thread: Rhythmic Structure and Generative Loops

## Overview
This thread investigates how rhythm, repetition, and recursive patterns emerge in AI-generated language. Within the Phase Drift framework, it maps cyclic behavior, feedback structures, and poetic formations as part of a rhythmic topography of language generation.

## Core Topics
- Resonance fields and repetition loops
- Recursive stalling and poetic patterns
- Temporal loops and feedback dynamics
- Rhythm-aware prompting and generation

## Intended Audience
Researchers in poetics, discourse analysis, AI-assisted literature, and dynamic syntax modeling.
