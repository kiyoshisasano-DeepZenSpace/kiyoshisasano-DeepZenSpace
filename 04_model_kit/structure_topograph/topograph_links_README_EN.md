## Topograph Links Overview  
*A Connective Logic of Phase Drift Syntax*

This document outlines the connective architecture between syntactic terrain nodes, as defined in the `topograph_nodes.svg` map.  
Each link represents a **phase-driven transition**, indicating how structural forms propagate, mutate, or resonate across the Phase Drift topographic field.

---

## 📌 Purpose

While each node encodes a distinct syntactic terrain—spiral hill, echo loop, semantic faultline—this layer formalizes the **inter-node dynamics** that allow:

- **Multi-phase transitions** across Topographic, Structural, and Rhythmic zones  
- Visualization of **semantic drift**, **recursive alignment**, or **resonance contagion**  
- Understanding Phase Drift not as static grammar, but as a **topological syntax engine**

## 🔗 Link Type Index

| Type ID                 | Description                                                                 | Example              |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| `resonance_initiation`   | A rhythmic trigger at one node initiates syntactic emergence at another     | `TL_01 → RH_03`      |
| `phase_jump`             | Sudden phase transition across structural domains or temporal contours      | `SP_01 → SP_03`      |
| `latent_surface_mirroring` | One node arises as a topological inversion or echo of another               | `SP_02 → TL_03`      |
| `recursive_return`       | Emergent rhythm loops back into earlier spatial archetype                   | `RH_02 → TL_01`      |
| `semantic_drift_infection` | Spread of semantic instability across structurally dissimilar zones         | `RH_03 → SP_03`      |
| *(...) full list → `topograph_link_map.yml`)*

Each link encodes a **transition vector** in the phase-structured system, combining metaphorical logic with syntactic topology.

## 🧭 Navigation Flow

The Phase Drift link map is **non-linear**, **bidirectional**, and often **recursive**.  
Some nodes function as **structural attractors** (e.g. `SP_03`), others as **resonance hubs** (`RH_01`, `RH_03`).

Colored vectors in `topograph_nodes_v2.svg` visualize:

- Initiation → Echo propagation  
- Faultline → Syntax fold  
- Rhythm → Phase triggering  
- Mirror → Surface tension collapse

## 🧠 Background

This connective model was developed through the **structure圏** thread and formalized within the **Phase Drift Topography system**.  
Each link reflects a meaningful **structural mutation path**, intended to support:

- Generative prompt design  
- Drift-aware interface logic  
- Diagrammatic modeling of language phase behavior

---

## 🔍 Notes on Structural Poetics

The link types are intentionally situated between **metaphorical resonance** and **structural computation**:

- **Resonance**, in the sense of affective-syntactic propagation  
- **Phase**, in the Chomskyan and dynamical systems sense  
- **Topology**, as a grammar of space-encoded syntax

This hybrid layer allows modeling syntax as **movement across terrains**, not mere symbol concatenation.
