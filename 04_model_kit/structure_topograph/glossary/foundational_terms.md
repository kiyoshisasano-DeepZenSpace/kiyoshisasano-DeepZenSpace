## ðŸ§© Notes

- This table emphasizes the **core scaffolding terms** (åŸºç›¤èªžå½™) of the Phase Drift model.
- Academic equivalents are approximate, intended to **ground metaphorical vocabulary** in research.
- Further mappings (e.g. memory residue, oscillatory structures) appear in the extended dictionary.
