## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- This mapping reflects **applied and metaphorical terms** that go beyond traditional syntax.
- Correspondences are approximations and serve to help situate the Phase Drift lexicon in existing academic literature.
- Future versions will provide multilingual exports and machine-readable `.ttl` and `.json` formats.
