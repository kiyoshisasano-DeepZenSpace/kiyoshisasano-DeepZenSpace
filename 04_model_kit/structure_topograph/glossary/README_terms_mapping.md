# 🧭 Phase Drift Vocabulary Mapping Index

> This README introduces the **terminological mapping layer** of the Phase Drift project. It provides structured bridges between original Phase Drift terminology and corresponding academic concepts in linguistics, cognitive science, and AI research.

## 📁 File Overview

| File Name                    | Description |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| `foundational_terms.md`     | Core scaffolding vocabulary (“基盤語彙”) aligned with academic grammar, discourse, and HCI frameworks. |
| `applied_terms_mapping.md`  | Applied and dynamic Phase Drift terms mapped to usage-based, pragmatic, and computational analogues. |

These files are intended as:
- 🧩 Interpretation tools for researchers entering the Phase Drift framework.
- 📚 Cross-referencing resources for linguists, semanticists, and NLP practitioners.
- 📐 Anchoring guides for future modules, including ontological export (.json / .ttl) and multilingual glossaries.

---

## 📌 Scope and Intent

- Each Phase Drift term is treated as a **metaphoric or operational construct**, not merely a label.
- Mappings are intentionally **cross-disciplinary**, blending:
  - Generative Syntax (e.g., Phase Theory, Cartography)
  - Pragmatics / Discourse (e.g., Adjacency Pairs, Turn-taking)
  - Cognitive Models (e.g., Residual Activation, Attention Structures)
  - AI / NLP (e.g., Concept Drift, Structural Priming)

---

## 🧪 Future Extensions

- 🎛 JSON-LD and RDF versions of mappings for semantic interoperability
- 🌐 Translation sets for multilingual Phase Drift glossaries
- 🗺 Crosswalks into adjacent theoretical domains (e.g., poetic form, design theory, affective computation)
