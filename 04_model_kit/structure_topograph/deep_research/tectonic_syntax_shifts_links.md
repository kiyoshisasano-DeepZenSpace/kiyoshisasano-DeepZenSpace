# Deep Research Links: Tectonic Syntax Shifts

This document collects interdisciplinary research, analog models, and theoretical tools that support the development of the *Tectonic Syntax Shifts* concept in the Phase Drift Syntax Mapping framework.

## 🔍 Conceptual Foundations

### • Syntactic Cartography
- *Cinque, Guglielmo (1999).* *Adverbs and Functional Heads* — provides vertical maps of syntax layers.
- *Rizzi, Luigi (1997). “The Fine Structure of the Left Periphery”* — source for pinpointing syntactic rupture zones.

### • Phase Theory in Minimalism
- *Chomsky (2000, 2001):* Derivation by Phase — origins of the idea that syntax unfolds in discrete "phase" operations, enabling fault-line modeling.
- *Legate (2003):* *Phases and Cyclicity* — offers empirical diagnostics of phase transitions.

## 🌍 Metaphorical & Dynamical Analogues

### • Tectonic Metaphor in Linguistics
- *Talmy (2000):* *Toward a Cognitive Semantics* — maps metaphor systems involving motion, force, and rupture.
- *Kövecses (2002):* *Metaphor: A Practical Introduction* — useful for conceptualizing syntax as a shifting structure.

### • Dynamical Systems & Rupture Theory
- *Strogatz (1994):* *Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos* — foundational for modeling bifurcation in generative systems.
- *Buzsáki (2006):* *Rhythms of the Brain* — links phase locking and sudden jumps in cognitive patterns.

## 🧠 AI & LLM Behavior Research

### • Instability in Generative Outputs
- *Elhage et al. (Anthropic, 2022):* *Toy Models of Superposition* — describes how small changes in vector space cause large output differences.
- *OpenAI (2023):* *GPT Behavior Across Temperature and Prompt Shifts* — empirical detection of tipping points in syntax structure.
- *Andreas, Jacob (2023):* *Language Models as Mechanistic Systems* — describes structure-preserving vs. reconfiguring zones.

## 🧪 Experimental Approaches

- Prompt delta testing: create nearly identical prompts and chart divergence
- Latent space visualization: use PCA/UMAP on LLM activations to find fault planes
- Coherence monitoring: track NLI/parsing consistency drop across generations

## 🧭 Visual Integration

This research informs future enhancements to:
- `structure_topograph.svg` (fault-line overlays)
- `topograph_links.yml` (marking volatile zones between structures)
- Interactive sandbox environments for structure rupture simulation
