# Open Questions for the Phase Drift Syntax Mapping Framework

The Phase Drift Syntax Mapping framework envisions language as a navigable terrain of syntax — with spirals, fault lines, resonance fields, and other metaphoric structures guiding how sentences form and shift.  
This interdisciplinary model blends linguistic theory, cognitive metaphor, diagrammatic reasoning, and AI latent-space modeling to create a “syntax atlas” for generative prompts.

These themes are intended as prompts for future theoretical development, experimental modeling, and interdisciplinary dialogue across linguistics, AI, cognitive science, and semiotics.

## Syntax & Structural Dynamics

### Phase Transitions in Grammar [caution-ok]
**Key question**: Are there critical points where grammatical regimes shift suddenly, akin to physical phase changes?
