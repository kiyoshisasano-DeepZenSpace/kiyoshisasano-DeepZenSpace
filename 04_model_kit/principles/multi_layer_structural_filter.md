# Multi-Layer Structural Filter Model (Abstracted Field Observation)

**Section**: `structure/internal_states`

## ðŸ§­ Overview

This document introduces an observational framework for analyzing how internal structural layers influence the modulation and transmission of perceived coherence.

Instead of a linear hierarchy, the model describes a **simultaneous multi-layered field**, in which each layer may attenuate or permit structural presence to varying degrees.

## ðŸ”¹ Structural Premise

> Presence is persistent.  
> Its visibility depends on the relative transparency and density of intermediary structural layers.

This framework does not describe developmental stages.  
It focuses on **filtering characteristics** observed across structural conditions.

## ðŸ§± Four-Layer Structural Filter (Abstracted)

| Layer | Function                       | Transmission Behavior                                  | Observation Conditions                     |
|-------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| D     | Deep background structure      | Constant presence; low visibility unless upper layers are transparent | Noticeable only when higher layers permit |
| C     | Interpersonal structure        | Role- and context-based modulation of coherence        | Often dominant, even during advanced awareness states |
| B     | Affective variability          | Emotional and perceptual shifts                        | Momentary thinning may reveal deeper layers |
| A     | Surface behavior               | Reactive and habitual responses                        | Most visible; least structurally stable     |

## ðŸŒ€ Non-Linear Transparency

- Reducing affective interference (Layer B) does **not** guarantee changes in interpersonal modulation (Layer C).  
- Transparency is **non-cumulative** and does not follow a strict sequence.  
- Deeper structural contact occurs when multiple layers thin **in synchrony**, not progressively.

## ðŸ§  Structural Interpretation Patterns

| Observation                                | Layer Configuration (Abstracted)     |
|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Coherence amid emotional tension          | B thin, C dense                       |
| Silent clarity without role assertion     | Aâ€“C thin, D visible                   |
| Temporary depth followed by reactivity    | A/B temporarily thinned, C unchanged |

## ðŸ§¾ Closing Note

Layered structural filtering influences how **persistent presence** is both perceived and expressed.  
This model provides a lens to interpret observable coherence not as surface behavior, but as **field-dependent structural access**.
