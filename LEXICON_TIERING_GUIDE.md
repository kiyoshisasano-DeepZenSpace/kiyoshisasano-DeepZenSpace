# 📘 Phase Drift – Lexical Tiering & Usage Stability Guidelines (v0.4)

> ⚠️ This document outlines **lexical tier classification**, **usage-level stability**,  
> and a **safe term appendix** for both tentative and structurally sound terms  
> used in the *Phase Drift* framework. It supports theoretical consistency, safe reuse,  
> and cross-domain intelligibility.

## 🧭 Tag System

| Tag        | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `@core`    | **Foundational** concept – anchors other terms and system logic |
| `@support` | **Contextual** term – depends on core terms for structure or clarity |
| `@derived` | **Emergent** concept – manifests from interaction between terms or states |

---

## ✅ Usage Stability Levels

| Symbol | Stability Label               | Description |
|--------|-------------------------------|-------------|
| 🟢     | Stable with minor annotation  | Coherent enough for cautious use across threads |
| 🟡     | Cautious use – frame required | Needs interpretive anchoring or contextual boundary |
| 🔴     | High instability – avoid      | Too fluid or metaphorical for reliable reuse |

## 🔡 Lexicon Tier Table (Tentative/Unstable Terms)

| Term                  | Tier        | Stability | Usage Notes |
|-----------------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Drift**             | `@core`     | 🔴        | Use only with scope qualifiers (e.g. “semantic drift,” “structural drift”) and contextual clarity. Avoid standalone use in formal logic. |
| **Phase**             | `@core`     | 🟢        | Safe for internal documentation. Anchor to turn-taking, coherence cycles, or discourse segmentation. |
| **Structural Tension**| `@support`  | 🔴        | Conceptual metaphor. Use only in interpretive logs or speculative commentary. |
| **Rhythm**            | `@support`  | 🟡        | Define explicitly (not prosody). Clarify application (e.g., interaction timing, response cadence). |
| **Field**             | `@core`     | 🔴        | Metaphor-heavy. Use only with explicit definition (e.g., “attentional field,” “relational field”). |
| **Phase Boundary**    | `@derived`  | 🟡        | Acceptable when paired with segmentation logic or transition markers. |
| **Resonance**         | `@derived`  | 🔴        | Avoid in structural claims. Illustrative use only (e.g., "resonance of prior syntax"). |
| **Silence**           | `@support`  | 🟡        | Context required. Tie to conversation analysis, latency mapping, or interaction structure. |
| **Coherence**         | `@derived`  | 🟡        | Specify dimension (e.g., “semantic coherence,” “rhythmic coherence”). Avoid abstract use. |
| **Latent Phase**      | `@derived`  | 🔴        | Use only in hypothetical mode (“possible latent phase indicators…”). Not yet formally supported. |

## ✅ Supplement: Safe Term Lexicon v0.1-draft

> This appendix presents a set of **structurally safe and externally explainable terms**  
> drawn from Phase Drift's discourse architecture. These are suitable for reuse in documentation,  
> educational material, and cross-disciplinary modeling.

### 🔑 Safe Term Criteria

- Widely supported in existing literature (linguistics, HCI, cognitive science)
- Low metaphorical ambiguity
- Stable scope and transferable structure
- Usable without interpretive framing

### 📌 Deployment Scenarios

| Use Case                   | Recommendation        |
|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Internal docs              | ✅ Use freely           |
| Academic writing           | ✅ Use with citations   |
| Cross-domain collaboration | ✅ Use as shared layer  |
| Phase Drift theory core    | ❌ Do not anchor models |

## 🔏 Safety Note

This lexicon defines **operational scaffolding terms**, not core generative metaphors.  
Unlike `Drift`, `Field`, or `Latent Phase`, these terms can **stand alone** with minimal risk of misinterpretation.
