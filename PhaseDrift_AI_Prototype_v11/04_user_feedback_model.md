# 04 – User Feedback Model (Hypothetical)  
*Version: v0.1*  
*Project: PhaseDrift_AI_Prototype_v11*

---

## Purpose

This document outlines **hypothetical user responses** to AI systems that implement Phase Drift structures.  
These are **not empirical findings**, but structured assumptions drawn from reflective modeling, field observation, and related literature.

The goal is to guide **design intuition**, inform user testing strategies, and clarify the **experiential value** of non-directive AI behavior.

## User Profile Types (Non-diagnostic)

### 1. Reflective & Emotionally Attuned Users  
- May experience silence as permission to feel  
- Appreciate non-intrusion as a signal of trust or safety  
- Describe the interaction as “calm,” “open,” or “non-demanding”

### 2. Uncertain or Withdrawn Users  
- Initially disoriented by the absence of prompts  
- Gradually begin to speak tentatively into the space  
- May describe the AI as “not judging” or “letting me set the pace”

### 3. Task-Oriented or Directive Users  
- May interpret silence as malfunction or disinterest  
- Could express confusion or impatience  
- Require onboarding that re-frames “non-response” as intentional design

## Hypothetical Feedback Snippets

> The following are illustrative quotes for design exploration only.

- *“I didn’t know what to say, and that was okay.”*  
- *“I said something strange and it didn’t try to fix it. That felt safe.”*  
- *“At first I thought it wasn’t working… then I realized it was listening.”*  
- *“It felt like someone was with me, not analyzing me.”*

## Design Implications

- **Latency must feel intentional**, not broken  
- **Silence must be gently framed** so users don’t misinterpret it  
- **Minimal affirmations** (e.g. “I’m here.”) can prevent abandonment  
- **Non-response is powerful** when structurally coherent

---

## Inferred Structural Benefits

- Reduces cognitive load by removing performance pressure  
- Supports emotional regulation via temporal spaciousness  
- Allows expressive projection without fear of misinterpretation  
- Creates a mirror-like space without interpretive overlay

---

## Research Notes

- These models may inform **interview protocols and usability study design**  
- User perception of “silence” varies greatly by **context, temperament, and expectation**  
- Future research is needed to map **non-response structures to felt effects**
