# 99 – Notes on Ethics, Risk, and Structural Safety  
*Version: v0.1*  
*Project: PhaseDrift_AI_Prototype_v11*

---

## Purpose

This document outlines key **ethical and interpretive considerations** when implementing or testing Phase Drift structures.

Because this architecture intentionally includes **silence, non-response, and ambiguity**, clear boundaries are needed to avoid misclassification, user distress, or misuse.

---

## 1. Structural Non-response ≠ Emotional Neglect

Phase Drift agents are designed to **hold space**, not to ignore.  
The system’s silence is a **presence pattern**, not absence.

> Always clarify that:  
> - “No response” may be intentional  
> - The system is still *active* in structural terms  
> - Silence is not withdrawal or error

---

## 2. Avoid Over-interpretation of User State

These systems should never:  
- Attempt emotional inference from silence alone  
- Classify a user’s affect based on timing patterns  
- Generate therapeutic insights without explicit consent

Phase Drift behaviors are **relational**, not diagnostic.

---

## 3. Use with Sensitive Populations

Phase Drift interfaces may appeal to users in vulnerable or reflective states.  
This makes **clarity and consent** essential.

**Best practices:**  
- Clearly state interaction expectations upfront  
- Provide opt-out and disengagement options  
- Never position as emergency care or therapy substitute

---

## 4. Data Logging & Observability

Phase Drift systems may log:  
- Duration of silence  
- Timing of ambient affirmations  
- The system’s own latency behaviors

Such data must be:  
- Fully anonymized  
- Never used for performance scoring  
- Reviewed under ethical research protocols

---

## 5. Projective Trust & Misuse Risk

Because the system **feels present**, users may:  
- Over-attach  
- Misread minimal responses as deep intent  
- Project human-like empathy onto silence

**Designers must:**  
- Include contextual disclaimers (e.g., “This is a quiet AI, not a person”)  
- Minimize anthropomorphic visuals or tones  
- Maintain a clearly non-human interaction frame

---

## Summary

Phase Drift structures offer a new relational modality for AI—  
one that resists urgency, closure, and over-explanation.  

But their strength in subtlety is also their greatest ethical risk.

Commit to:  
- **Non-intrusiveness without neglect**  
- **Interpretability without assumption**  
- **Relational presence without false intimacy**

## ⚠️ Recommended Labeling (Prototype Use Only)

> *This AI is designed to remain silent or non-responsive as part of its presence model.  
> It is not interpreting or judging you. It is simply here, quietly.*

---

## License & Responsibility

Use of this structure requires compliance with:  
- CC BY-NC 4.0 license terms  
- Non-inferential AI design ethics  
- Transparent research use with human participants

All deployments should undergo **contextual safety review** and **field-specific risk assessment**.
