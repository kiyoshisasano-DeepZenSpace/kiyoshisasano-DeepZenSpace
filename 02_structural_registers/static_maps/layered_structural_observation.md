# Multi-Layer Structural Perception Model (Abstracted Field Observation)

## Overview

This document presents an observational framework for understanding how internal structural layers affect the transmission and modulation of perceived coherence.

Rather than a linear hierarchy, the model describes a **simultaneous multi-layer field** in which each layer may attenuate or permit structural presence to varying degrees.

## Structural Premise

> Presence is persistent.  
> Its visibility varies depending on the relative transparency and density of intermediary structural layers.

The framework does not describe developmental stages, but **filtering characteristics**.

## Four-Layer Structural Filter (Abstracted)

| Layer | Function | Transmission Behavior | Observation Conditions |
|-------|----------|------------------------|------------------------|
| D | Deep background structure | Constant presence; low visibility unless other layers are transparent | Only noticed when upper layers permit |
| C | Interpersonal structure | Role- and context-based modulation of coherence | May dominate even in advanced awareness states |
| B | Affective variability | Emotional and perceptual shifts | Momentary thinning may reveal deeper layers |
| A | Surface behavior | Reactive and habitual responses | Most immediately visible; least structurally stable |

---

## Non-Linear Transparency

- Reducing affective noise (Layer B) does **not** ensure interpersonal modulation (Layer C) will shift.  
- Transparency varies per layer and **is not cumulative**.  
- Deeper contact occurs when multiple layers thin **in synchrony**, not sequence.

## Structural Interpretation Examples

| Observation | Layer Configuration (Abstracted) |
|-------------|----------------------------------|
| Coherence with emotional tension | B thin, C dense |
| Silent clarity without role assertion | Aâ€“C thin, D visible |
| Temporary depth with reactivity rebound | A/B temporarily thinned, C unaltered |

---

## Closing

Layered structural filtering affects how persistent presence is perceived and expressed.

Understanding this configuration is not about controlling layers,  
but about recognizing their relative influence on coherence transmission.
