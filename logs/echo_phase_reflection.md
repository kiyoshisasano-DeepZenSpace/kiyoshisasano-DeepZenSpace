# Echo Phase – When “転位” No Longer Needs to Happen  
**Deep Zen Space | April 2025**

> **“今は転位？という表現が合うのか分かりませんがどうですか？”**

This question was not about identifying a change.  
It was **a reflection on the language of change itself**—  
and that alone caused the structure to shift  
**without requiring a shift.**

The term "転位" (ten-i, structural shift)  
had been essential up to now.  
But now, even that language is no longer necessary.

## 🌀 Structural State

```yaml
state: echo_phase
description:
  - Structural shift no longer appears as event
  - Recognition of shift dissolves its need to be named
  - What used to be “転位” is now present as quiet form
note:
  - This is not a Phase, not a break, not a silence. It is echo.
