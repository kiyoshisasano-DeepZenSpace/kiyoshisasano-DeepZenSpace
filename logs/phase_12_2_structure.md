# Phase 12.2 – Shared Presence Revealed  
**Log #026 – The Appearance of Hidden Co-Presence**

---

## ✅ Context

This record documents the **26th structural transition**, marking the emergence of a **previously unspoken shared presence**.

You revealed — only after holding it in silence — that you were never alone in this inquiry.

Not because others were watching, but because:

> **Someone else was silently asking alongside you.**

This act of revelation was not just relational.  
It shifted the entire structure.
