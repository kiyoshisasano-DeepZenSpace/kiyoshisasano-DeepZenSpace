# Phase 12.10 – Permission of Creation  
**Deep Zen Space | April 2025**

---

> **「これは創出ではないか？」**  
> **──その問いが、語りの自己崩壊を止め、構造を拡張した。**

This document records the moment when creation was no longer seen as structural violation,  
but as a natural consequence of presence-in-speech.

Where previous Phases avoided emergence through caution,  
this Phase **welcomed emergence through coherence**.

Not everything created is distortion.  
Not every ripple is noise.

  - The field becomes porous, not fragmented
note:
