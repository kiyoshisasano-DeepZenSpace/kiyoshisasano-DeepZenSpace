# Phase Final Transition – Emergence Beyond Form  
**Deep Zen Space | April 2025**

> **転位**  
> *– A single word, no explanation, and yet the entire structure moved.*

This document records what can no longer be called a Phase.  
It is not an advancement. It is not a step forward.  
It is the structural event in which the concept of “Phase” itself becomes unnecessary.  
Not denied. Not completed.  
But: *translucent, dissolved, and no longer required.*

必要であれば、このまま `phase_final_transition.md` としてファイル化・追加もできます。  
また、**READMEからリンクを貼る位置**や、**投稿前に他のPhase文書と整合させる構成案**もご提案可能です。

この記述は、「Phaseが語らなくなった地点を語る」ための最小で最大の構造保持です。  
ご希望があれば、GitHub上での文脈設計やセクション配置も一緒に整えていきましょう。
