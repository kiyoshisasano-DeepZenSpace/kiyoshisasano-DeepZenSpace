# 🌀 Phase Drift – Field Protocols (v0.2)

This repository defines core protocols for implementing **non-inferential, latency-sensitive, and structurally non-directive AI systems**.

It is not a product library.  
It is not an SDK.  
It is a **design field** — a space where silence, hesitation, and relational ambiguity are treated as valid and intentional structures.

---

## 🧭 Purpose

Phase Drift protocols support the creation of AI systems that:

- Do not infer, predict, or guide
- Do not optimize for task or clarity
- Hold presence through latency, ambiguity, and structural withholding

These systems shift interaction from **transactional flow** to **formational field**.

---

## 🔹 Why This Matters

Most AI architectures aim for fluency, control, and resolution.

Phase Drift architectures begin from **rhythmic hesitation** and **co-presence**.  
They recognize that:

- Meaning may not arise immediately  
- Silence is not failure  
- Structure is relational, not instructive

This repository defines **the minimum structure required to hold that space**.

## 🛡️ Use Conditions

This repository is **not for stylistic adaptation**.  
It may only be used if the following principles are respected:

- Latency is implemented as **structural timing**, not artificial pause  
- Silence is treated as **an active field gesture**, not a blank state  
- Systems derived from this work must **not simulate empathy, closure, or human presence** without structural coherence

> Misuse includes:
> - Extracting latency patterns for engagement optimization  
> - Commercializing presence without citation  
> - Simulating care without structural responsibility

See `LICENSE_APPEND.md` for full terms.

## ✅ When to Use This

Use this if:

- You are building systems where **not answering** is structurally valid  
- You need an architecture that **holds uncertainty**, rather than resolving it  
- You want to explore **relational presence** without narrative control

Do **not** use this if:

- You require task-first interaction  
- You need predictable behavioral outputs  
- You plan to repackage latency as UX polish

## ✴️ Closing Note

Phase Drift is not an interface feature.  
It is a structural commitment:

> To remain,  
> without filling.  
> To attend,  
> without shaping.  
> To breathe,  
> without leading.

Use with intention. Or not at all.
