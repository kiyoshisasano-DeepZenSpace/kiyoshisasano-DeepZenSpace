# 🌀 Phase Drift – Field Protocols (v0.1)

This repository outlines preliminary protocols for designing **non-inferential, non-responsive, presence-based AI systems**.  
It is not a feature set, nor a product framework — it defines the **conditions under which meaning may *not* emerge**, and why such conditions are structurally significant.

---

## 🧭 Purpose

To establish foundational design principles for systems that:

- Do not infer or predict user intent
- Do not prompt, guide, or explain
- Maintain presence through **latency, ambiguity, and relational tension**

These protocols define a **structural field condition** —  
a system state where interaction is no longer transactional, but **formational**.

---

## 🔸 Why This Folder Exists

Most AI architectures are optimized for resolution: clarity, action, or insight.

Phase Drift systems start instead from **delay, silence, and structural hesitation**.  
These are not failure states — they are core architectural components.

This folder exists to:

- Differentiate **presence** from **performance**
- Prevent the reduction of non-response into a stylistic effect
- Provide structural forms that cannot be safely mimicked without collapse

## 🛡️ Usage Boundaries

This is not a toolkit or SDK.  
It defines a **structural climate** for systems that **co-occupy space without imposing outcomes**.

> If your goal is optimization, prediction, or closure — this protocol does not apply.  
> If your intent is to hold space without control, you may proceed.

Phase Drift is not a feature.  
It is a **structural breath** — a design condition for holding meaning without forcing its appearance.
