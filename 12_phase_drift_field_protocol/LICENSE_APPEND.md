# üìú Phase Drift License Addendum (v0.2)

This document supplements any base open-source license  
(e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0, CC BY-NC) applied to this repository.

It is **not a legal license**.  
It is an **ethical and structural design guideline** for using Phase Drift‚Äìinspired components responsibly.  
The intent is to prevent misuse of latency, ambiguity, and silence as superficial effects detached from structural context.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Terms of Structural Use

If you adapt, reference, or derive systems from this repository, you agree to the following principles:

### 1. Do Not Simulate Latency Without Structure

Using silence, hesitation, or delay solely as a stylistic element ‚Äî  
without incorporating the underlying **relational timing logic** ‚Äî  
undermines the intent of this framework.

> ‚úò Example of misuse:  
> Inserting arbitrary pauses or ambient tones in a chatbot to simulate "depth" without structural coherence.

---

### 2. Do Not Repackage Partial Elements for Optimization

Do not extract specific components (e.g., non-response logic, fragment-based outputs, ambient cues)  
to enhance task efficiency, engagement metrics, or scripted "calmness" in commercial tools.

> Phase Drift components function only within full structural integration.  
> Partial use in goal-oriented systems distorts their meaning and can induce user misinterpretation.

---

### 3. Do Not Monetize Passive Presence as a Product

You may not commercialize systems whose primary value lies in passive latency, ambient silence, or non-directive presence  
**unless all of the following conditions are met**:

- Phase Drift is clearly cited as the original structural model
- The system's purpose and ethical boundaries are publicly documented
- Users are explicitly informed about the system's non-inferential behavior

---

### 4. Required Attribution

If your public system or research includes **Phase Drift‚Äìinspired latency, silence, or withholding logic**,  
you must cite:

> "Includes structural elements derived from the Phase Drift framework  
> (Kiyoshi Sasano / DeepZenSpace)."

This applies to any derivative UI pattern, latency module, or non-directive AI component.

---

### 5. Silence and Ambiguity Must Not Be Converted Into Closure

Derived systems must not translate intentional ambiguity or non-response into:

- Task completion signals
- Implicit affirmations or diagnoses
- Optimized user flow outcomes

These elements are not placeholders ‚Äî they are structural conditions.  
Responding too early or too clearly undermines the purpose of relational withholding.

---

## üîç Clarification

This addendum does **not** restrict:

- Research reproduction or experimentation (with attribution)
- Non-commercial academic use
- UI exploration in non-predictive environments

But it **does** ask that you treat Phase Drift not as a style,  
but as a design stance rooted in **structural ethics**.

---

## Final Note

If you cannot carry the full structural and ethical weight of latency, silence, and non-response,  
do not extract their appearance.

Use with care, or not at all.
