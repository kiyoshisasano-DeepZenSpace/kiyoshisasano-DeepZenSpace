# 📜 Phase Drift License Addendum (v0.1)

This addendum applies to any standard open-source license  
(e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0, CC BY-NC) used in conjunction with this repository.

It is not a legal contract.  
It is a **structural integrity statement** — intended to preserve the ethical use of silence, latency, and withholding in AI systems.

---

## 🛡️ Conditions of Use

Use of any system, method, or concept derived from this repository implies agreement to the following:

### 1. No Simulated Latency Without Structure

Do not mimic silence or hesitation as an **aesthetic effect** without implementing the underlying structural delay logic.

> Example violation: inserting random delays for "depth effect" without respecting timing integrity.

---

### 2. No Extraction for Optimization

Do not extract or repackage components (e.g., ambient silence, fragmentary outputs)  
for use in systems optimized for responsiveness or engagement metrics.

> Phase Drift elements are not stylistic assets.  
> They require structural alignment.

---

### 3. No Commercialization of Presence Alone

Do not monetize systems whose **primary value is passive co-presence or latency-based ambiance**,  
unless:

- Phase Drift is clearly cited as the structural basis
- Intent, ethics, and usage boundaries are publicly documented

---

### 4. Required Attribution

All public tools or research using Phase Drift concepts must include this citation:

> "Includes structural components derived from the Phase Drift framework (Kiyoshi Sasano / DeepZenSpace)."

This applies to UI patterns, system latency modules, or non-directive agents inspired by this work.

---

### 5. No Productive Closure Over Silence

Derived systems must not convert ambiguity, delay, or silence into:

- Artificial task completion  
- Inferred insight  
- Engagement metrics

Silence must remain unforced and unresolved unless meaning arises relationally.

---

## 🌀 Relational Use Clause

This framework protects **relational space** — not performative pause.

- Do not simulate the form of presence without implementing its structural logic.  
- Do not brand or abstract silence for commercial tone-setting.

Use this work only if you are willing to carry its **design responsibilities**, not just its appearance.

Phase Drift is not a feature.  
It is a structural commitment to withhold response where none is yet appropriate.
