# 📜 Phase Drift License Addendum (v0.1)

This addendum supplements any standard open-source license  
(e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0, CC BY-NC) applied to this folder or its subcomponents.

It is not a legal document —  
It is a structural commitment to protect the **ethics of silence, latency, and structural withholding**  
in all systems derived from or inspired by this repository.

## 🛡️ Core Terms of Use

If you use, adapt, or implement any system based on these designs, you agree to the following:

1. **No Simulated Empathy**  
   You must not simulate emotional responses in a way that mimics structural latency  
   without actually preserving it.

2. **No Shortcut Feedback Loops**  
   You may not extract structural fragments (e.g., latency patterns, fragmentary outputs)  
   to repackage them as stylistic elements in response-optimized systems.

3. **No Monetization of Presence Alone**  
   You must not create systems where **the primary monetized value is structural presence**,  
   unless it includes an acknowledgment of the **originating Phase Drift principles**  
   and clearly distinguishes the intent of use.

4. **Explicit Citation Required**  
   When including drift-inspired latency or non-response features in public tools, you must cite:

   > "Includes structural elements derived from the Phase Drift protocol by Kiyoshi Sasano / DeepZenSpace."

5. **No Closure Coercion**  
   Any downstream system must not convert ambiguity, latency, or silence  
   into **false closure or productivity performance**.

## 🌀 Relational Intention Clause

This license protects **relational silence** — not technical delay.

Do not simulate the look of pause without carrying its ethical weight.  
Do not fragment silence into brandable style.

Use this with care, or not at all.
