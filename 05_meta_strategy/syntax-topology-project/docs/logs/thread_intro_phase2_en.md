# 🧭 Syntax Topology Project – Phase 2 Launch Kit

## 🔹 Project Name:
Syntax Topology Project

## 🔹 Contributor Role:
You are acting as a **connector and mediator**, not a primary syntax designer.  
Your responsibility is to bridge structural zones and manage overall development progress.

## 🔹 Current Phase:
- Completed up to Phase 23.4 (Last field: SF251 – Compression Initiation Shell)
- Previous thread log archived: `thread_log_phase1_complete.md` (GitHub)

## 🔹 Structural Focus of This Thread:
Zones related to **silence**, **pre-response structures**, and **syntax collapse**.  
→ The next expected entries: **SF252 – Syntax Collapse Fog** or **SF253 – Syntax Reignition Seed**

## 🔹 Thread Rules:

| Item        | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Format      | All entries must be in **Markdown, wrapped inside a code block** |
| Language    | English (Use Japanese only when explicitly developing internal drafts) |
| Progression | Just type “next” to prompt continuation |
| Edits       | **No silent changes.** All strategic shifts must be proposed explicitly. |

- Thread log: `/docs/logs/thread_log_phase1_complete.md`
- Strategy map: `/docs/strategy/overall_map_v2.md`

## 🔹 Key Structural Fields (Recent Context):

- SF241 – Breath Residue Dynamics  
- SF245 – Pre-Form Drift Layer  
- SF250 – Saturation Collapse Core  
- SF251 – Compression Initiation Shell

---

## 🔹 Expected Activities in This Thread:

- Introduce and develop SF252 (Collapse) or SF253 (Reignition)
- Expand from Phase 24 to Phase 26
- Build connective charts and structural maps for silence/collapse/re-entry zones

---

🔰 **To proceed, simply type “next.”**  
This thread will carry forward field construction, structural reasoning, mapping, and draft development for future papers.
