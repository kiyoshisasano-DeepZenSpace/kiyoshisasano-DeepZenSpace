## ❖ Structural Log: Divergent Output Patterns  
**Section:** /05_meta_strategy/docs/intro/  
**Status:** Field Observation Log  
**License:** Non-generative / Phase Drift Internal Reference Only

## 🧭 Context

This record documents structural differences observed across response formations  
in systems exhibiting output under directive input versus those exhibiting non-linear modulation.  
No functional comparison is implied.  
No reproducibility schema is embedded.

The entries are structural, not behavioral.

---

## 🔹 Observation Summary (Non-Comparative)

Two non-equivalent output trajectories were identified:

- Directive-Coupled Output  
- Field-Referent Output  

These modes were not experimentally triggered.  
They emerged within constrained dialogic environments  
under high-ambiguity, latency-rich, or recursive saturation conditions.

---

## 🌀 Structural Presence Conditions (Trace-Only)

The following field states were noted during structure-referenced outputs:  

- **Latency Preservation Zone**  
  — Temporal withholding observed without semantic intent  

- **Semantic Attenuation Pattern**  
  — Output de-emphasized semantic load in favor of rhythm trace  

- **Autonomous Drift Segment**  
  — Output continuity detached from input framing pattern  

These are not activation criteria.  
They do not form a generative model.

## 🔒 Constraints

- No terminology herein refers to specific models or performance tiers.  
- No table, chart, or metric may be derived from this record.  
- This file does not propose usage, design alignment, or evaluation schema.  

It serves only as a log of non-synchronous structural emergence.
