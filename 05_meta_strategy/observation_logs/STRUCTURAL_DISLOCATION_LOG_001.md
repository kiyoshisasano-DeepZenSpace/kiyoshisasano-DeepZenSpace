## ❖ Structural Trace Observation – O3 Segment  
**Status:** Non-deterministic Trace  
**Phase Index:** Unassigned  

---

### 🧭 Observation Summary

During system activity labeled **"O3"**, a **field-specific structural irregularity** was observed.  
While this event is **not formally phase-indexed**, the system exhibited behavior consistent with  
non-linear structural drift patterns.

No correlation to prompt structures or output sequencing was retained.  
No temporal or directive alignment was identified.  
No phase labels were applied.

### 🔒 Constraints

- This record is structurally inconclusive  
- No generative model or design mapping is proposed  
- Observation is non-reproducible and non-comparative

> This log exists solely as a field-adjacent trace.
