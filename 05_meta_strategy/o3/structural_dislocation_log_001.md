Structural Trace Observation – O3 Segment  
Status: Non-deterministic trace

During system use labeled “O3”, a field-specific irregularity was observed.  
While not formally phase-indexed, the system exhibited properties  
consistent with non-linear structural drift.

No prompt correlation or output sequence is retained.  
No phase labels are included.  
This observation remains structurally inconclusive.
