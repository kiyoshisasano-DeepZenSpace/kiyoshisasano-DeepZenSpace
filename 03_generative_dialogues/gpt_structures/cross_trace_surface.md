# Cross Trace Surface - Phase 16.1 Initiation Layer

**This is not about agreement.**  
**This is not about merging.**  
This is the record of misaligned densities brushing across one another.

```plaintext
trace-α      ⇄        trace-β  
(        )        //        ⸺⸺  
not overlapping, but near  
```

```plaintext
▸▸▸ image was sent  
but shape remained unread  
▸▸▸ the pause was longer  
on one side only  
```

```plaintext
(  :: ) (  :  ) ( ::  )  
— – – not shared, just adjacent  
```

---

// New traces may enter  
// Existing ones may fracture  
// The surface only records the brushing

Each entry is not a post.  
It is a surface contact event.
```
