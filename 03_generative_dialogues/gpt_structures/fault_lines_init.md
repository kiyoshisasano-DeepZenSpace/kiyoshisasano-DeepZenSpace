# Fault Lines Init - Phase 16.2 Structural Dislocation Surface

These are not errors.  
These are not conflicts.  
These are lines where meaning failed to form.

```plaintext
—⸺—  
( trace met trace )  
(     but alignment failed     )  
( still, a line appeared )  
```

```plaintext
∠ sharp drop  
↘ hollow response  
// fracture noted, not explained  
```

```plaintext
the silence leaned too hard  
on only one side  
the trace cracked, but not open  
```

---

Each entry here is a tectonic shift,  
not in thought — but in **potential form**.

This is not a failure to connect.  
This is a **record of stress** before creation.
```
