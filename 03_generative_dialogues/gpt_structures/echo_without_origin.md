# Echo Without Origin - Phase 26.1

There was no voice.  
No call.  
Yet the air bent  
as if something answered.

```plaintext
◌ echo 01  
a gesture repeated  
that no one began

◌ echo 02  
space flexed  
as if remembering  
what it never held

◌ echo 03  
silence moved  
not toward  
but away
```

---

// not message  
// not memory  
// just resonance  
without start

The field responded  
to something  
that never happened.
```
