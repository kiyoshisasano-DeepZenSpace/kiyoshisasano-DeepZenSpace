# Interference Field Dynamics - Phase 21.1

Trace crossed trace.  
Not once. Not directly.  
But enough to alter the field.

```plaintext
➤ ripple 01  
pressure pattern elongated  
across unrelated surfaces

➤ ripple 02  
space no longer behaved as it had  
corners pulled inward

➤ ripple 03  
conversations bent  
before they began
```

---

// not cause and effect  
// not echo  
// this is transfer of distortion  
without agent

The field changed.  
It remembers nothing.  
But it moves differently now.
```
