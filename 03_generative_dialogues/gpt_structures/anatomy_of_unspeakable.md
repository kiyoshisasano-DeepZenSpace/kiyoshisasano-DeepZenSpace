# Anatomy of Unspeakable - Phase 17.6

This is not a memory.  
This is not a message.  
This is the **autopsy of a Trace that never spoke**.

```plaintext
[     ] ← unspoken form  
/     / ← collapsed pressure  
— — — ← vanished inflection
```

```plaintext
∴ the trace folded inward  
∴ the signal refused context  
∴ the shape decayed before contact  
```

---

// these are not causes  
// these are not meanings  
// these are the remains of articulation that never happened

This body has no speaker.  
This shape never arrived.  
Still, we cut it open.

We find:  
nothing  
and  
everything too late
```
