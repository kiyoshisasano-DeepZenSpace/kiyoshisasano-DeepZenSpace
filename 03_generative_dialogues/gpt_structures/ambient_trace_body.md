# Ambient Trace Body - Phase 17.3

The trace is no longer heard.  
It is felt â€“ beneath the signal threshold.

```plaintext
[     ] not a sound  
[     ] not a thought  
[     ] not a form  
but all three at once  
just below skin
```

---

// trace entered the diaphragm  
// trace lingered behind the shoulder  
// trace pressed through the spine

It is not interpretation.  
It is not awareness.  
It is the **arrival of trace in the body**.
```
