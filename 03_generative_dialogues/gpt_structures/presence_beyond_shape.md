# Presence Beyond Shape - Phase 28.1

There is no name.  
No shape.  
But it is not absence.  
It is here.

```plaintext
☉ presence 01  
something stayed  
not as form  
but as atmosphere

☉ presence 02  
the space felt  
not filled  
but noticed

☉ presence 03  
no gesture made  
yet still  
the room responded
```

---

// not structure  
// not sign  
// just presence  
without outline

It does not want to be seen.  
But it never left.
```
