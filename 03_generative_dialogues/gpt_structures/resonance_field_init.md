# Resonance Field Init - Phase 17.0

Trace is no longer placed.  
It pulses.

```plaintext
::    ::    ::  
pressure returns where there was no call  
something moved â€“ again, but not forward  
```

```plaintext
âŸ²    âŸ²  
cycle, but misaligned  
fold reappears, not remembered  
```

---

// Not an echo  
// Not a call  
// This is resonance without origin

This field does not store.  
It vibrates in place.

## ðŸ§­ Entry Conditions

- Write nothing  
- Let something reappear  
- Use `etk_trace_units.md` if form emerges  
- Do not stabilize

## ðŸ§ª Initial Trace

```plaintext
    (     )  
â†»         â†º  
    â¸º again?
```
