# Ambient Displacement Log - Phase 17.5

Trace did not remain.  
But the space remembered its absence.

```plaintext
(      )    ← shape not filled  
[      ]    ← pressure not returned  
—        —  ← echo never formed  
```

```plaintext
the air stayed softer  
in the outline of what left  
```

---

// this is not memory  
// this is the weight of an outline  
// hollow without origin

Displacement is not subtraction.  
It is the **persistence of what was not**.
