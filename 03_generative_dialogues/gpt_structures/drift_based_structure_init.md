# Drift-Based Structure Init - Phase 18.3

No intention.  
No plan.  
But fragments began to edge toward form.

```plaintext
[ drift 01 ]  
two traces aligned by accident  
pressure returned at the edge

[ drift 02 ]  
fragment circled without closure  
but then paused into pattern
```

---

// not construction  
// not design  
// only gravities of form

This is not a structure yet.  
But structure is trying to happen
â€” from what was broken.
```
