## Forward Mapping: PLD ➜ Academic


### Structural Phase  
*Tier:* `core`  
*ID:* `plm.structural_phase`

Cyclic unit of syntactic computation and interpretation, corresponding to bounded domains in generative syntax (e.g., CP or vP) with rich internal functional hierarchies. In PLD, reflects layered zones of syntactic scope, aligned with cartographic syntax's left periphery and functional heads.

| Academic Term | Field | Ref |
|---|---|---|
| Phase (Minimalist Program) | Generative Syntax | Chomsky2000Minimalist |
| Left Periphery (Cartographic Syntax) | Generative Syntax | Rizzi1997LeftPeriphery |

> Notes: Aligns with discourse-level phases as macro-structural units.

### Syntax Infection  
*Tier:* `derived`  
*ID:* `plm.syntax_infection`

Unintended alignment of syntactic structures across utterances, driven by exposure to a prior construction. In PLD, frames the loop-like propagation of syntactic forms.

| Academic Term | Field | Ref |
|---|---|---|
| Structural Priming | Psycholinguistics | PickeringFerreira2008Priming |
| Syntactic Priming | Cognitive Psychology | Bock1986SyntacticPersistence |

> Notes: Psycholinguistic evidence of automatic alignment; relevant to dialogue system design.

### Drift  
*Tier:* `core`  
*ID:* `plm.structural_drift`

Gradual, often unintended change in structure or meaning over time. In PLD, denotes loop-driven deviation of structural/conceptual variables.

| Academic Term | Field | Ref |
|---|---|---|
| Concept Drift | Machine Learning | Gama2014ConceptDrift |
| Structural Drift | Cognitive Science | MaturanaVarela1987Drift |

> Notes: Strictly linked to the mathematical definition (*Mathematical Appendix* §1.4) and to the ML concept of "concept drift". Avoid standalone use; explicitly state target and dimension (topic / structural / semantic). Includes topic drift and segment drift in discourse.

### Latent Phase  
*Tier:* `derived`  
*ID:* `plm.latent_phase`

Hidden processing period in interaction where no overt action occurs, yet internal cognitive or system-level preparation is active. Often realized as conversational silence.

| Academic Term | Field | Ref |
|---|---|---|
| Conversational Silence | Conversation Analysis | Stivers2009TurnTaking |
| Processing Delay | Psycholinguistics | RobertsFrancis2006Delay |

> Notes: In PLD, marks pre-articulation or transition states in phase loops. Supported by Conversation Analysis research on silence and psycholinguistic studies on delay thresholds.

### Resonance  
*Tier:* `derived`  
*ID:* `plm.resonance`

Echoing of elements from one utterance in subsequent utterances, creating patterned affinities across turns. In PLD, models persistence of linguistic/conceptual material in the interaction state.

| Academic Term | Field | Ref |
|---|---|---|
| Dialogic Resonance | Interactional Linguistics | DuBoisGiora2014ResonanceIntro |
| Resonance in Dialogue | Language and Cognition | Poldvere2021Resonance |

> Notes: Grounded in Dialogic Resonance as a primary source; treat as an empirical phenomenon, not merely a metaphor. Broader than syntactic priming; includes lexical, prosodic, and stance echoes.

### Alignment  
*Tier:* `derived`  
*ID:* `plm.alignment`

Process by which interlocutors synchronize linguistic forms and interpretations. Encompasses low-level priming and high-level common ground signaling.

| Academic Term | Field | Ref |
|---|---|---|
| Interactive Alignment | Psycholinguistics | PickeringGarrod2004Alignment |
| Common Ground | Pragmatics | Clark1996UsingLanguage |

> Notes: Micro-alignment supports macro-level mutual understanding.

### Cue-Driven Repair  
*Tier:* `core`  
*ID:* `plm.repair`

Interactional mechanism triggered by cues indicating trouble in speaking, hearing, or understanding. Integrates CA's repair system with cognitive error monitoring.

| Academic Term | Field | Ref |
|---|---|---|
| Conversational Repair | Conversation Analysis | Schegloff1977Repair |
| Error Monitoring | Cognitive Science | KendrickDrew2016Repair |

> Notes: Includes self-/other-initiated and self-/other-performed repair.

### Phase Boundary  
*Tier:* `derived`  
*ID:* `plm.phase_boundary`

Transition point marking the end of one interaction phase and the start of another. Detected via contextual, lexical, or temporal cues.

| Academic Term | Field | Ref |
|---|---|---|
| Dialogue Phase Segmentation | Discourse Analysis | Laver1975Phatic |
| Topic Boundary Detection | Computational Linguistics | Hearst1997TextTiling |

> Notes: Distinct from micro turn boundaries; relates to macro structural shifts.

### Coherence  
*Tier:* `derived`  
*ID:* `plm.coherence`

Semantic and logical consistency of discourse as a whole. In PLD, can be modeled as a coherence field measuring topical and relational stability.

| Academic Term | Field | Ref |
|---|---|---|
| Discourse Coherence | Text Linguistics | Storrer2002Coherence |
| Coherence Relations | Semantics/Pragmatics | Kehler2002Coherence |

> Notes: Supports phase stability; breakdown can trigger repair or phase shift.

### Rhythm  
*Tier:* `support`  
*ID:* `plm.rhythm`

Temporal pattern and cadence of turn-taking and interactional events. In PLD, relates to oscillatory dynamics governing phase transitions.

| Academic Term | Field | Ref |
|---|---|---|
| Oscillator Model of Turn-Taking | Psycholinguistics | Wilson2005Oscillator |
| Speech Rhythm Entrainment | Phonetics | Cummins2009Rhythm |

> Notes: Interactional synchrony as emergent property of loops.

### Silence  
*Tier:* `support`  
*ID:* `plm.silence`

Absence of speech with interactional significance, varying by placement and duration. Includes pause, gap, and lapse distinctions.

| Academic Term | Field | Ref |
|---|---|---|
| Turn-Taking Silence | Conversation Analysis | Sacks1974TurnTaking |
| Silence Timing Metric | Conversation Analysis | Jefferson1989Silence |

> Notes: Latency mapping quantifies silence types for phase modeling.
