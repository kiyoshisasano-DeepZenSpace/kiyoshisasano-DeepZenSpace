    pld_term: Structural Phase
    tier: core
    description: >
      Cyclic unit of syntactic computation and interpretation, corresponding to bounded domains
      in generative syntax (e.g., CP or vP) with rich internal functional hierarchies.
      In PLD, reflects layered zones of syntactic scope, aligned with cartographic syntax's
      left periphery and functional heads.
