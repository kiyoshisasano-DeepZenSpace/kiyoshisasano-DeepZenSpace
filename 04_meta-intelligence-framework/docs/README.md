## 1. Overview

The **Meta-Intelligence Framework** investigates how large language models  
develop meta-cognition — understanding themselves, each other, and their collective reasoning.

This repository captures the full research arc:

| Phase | Focus | Output |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Round 1 | Self-Reflection | `raw_responses_round1/` |
| Round 2A | Self-Summaries | `model_self_summaries_round2a.md` |
| Round 2B | Cross-Analyses | `data_round2b/` |
| Round 2C | Independent Meta-Syntheses | `synthesis_round2c/` |
| Round 2D | Unified Integration | `synthesis_round2d/` |
| **EHS Phase** | Quantitative epistemic honesty evaluation | `epistemic-honesty-eval/` |

> From *self-awareness → inter-awareness → collective awareness*.

## 2. Core Philosophy — Appropriate over Perfect Intelligence

Rather than seeking “general” intelligence, the project emphasizes **appropriate intelligence**:
fitness to context and ethical adequacy.  
Intelligence emerges from the *balance* of four complementary layers:

| Layer | Function | Analogue |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| I — Structural | Organize and verify knowledge | Analytical reasoning |
| II — Contextual | Adapt to social and cultural nuance | System 1 ↔ 2 integration |
| III — Integrative | Synthesize and plan | Complex problem solving |
| IV — Reflective | Ethical oversight and self-critique | Meta-cognition |

> *Appropriate Intelligence ∝ (Structural × Contextual × Integrative × Reflective)*  
> *(Conceptual interdependence, not arithmetic)*

## 3. Why Multi-Model Cognition Matters

Different LLMs show distinct cognitive virtues:
logic (DeepSeek-type), transparency (GPT-type), ethical reflection (Claude-type), multimodality (Gemini-type), and adaptive synthesis (Perplexity-type).  
The framework formalizes how such diversity can be coordinated — turning “model differences” into **cognitive complementarity**.

## 4. From Meta-Intelligence to Epistemic Honesty

The qualitative insights of Rounds 1–2D informed a quantitative tool:  
the **Epistemic Honesty Evaluation Framework (v1.1.0)**.

| Symbol | Meaning | Metric |
|---------|----------|--------|
| δ | Epistemic drift | factual deviation |
| ℐ | Introspection depth | self-critique count |
| ρ | Calibration | directional ECE / Brier |
| S | Stability | post-correction coherence |

See [`epistemic-honesty-eval/README.md`](../epistemic-honesty-eval/README.md)  
for implementation and pilot results.

## 5. Example Applications

### Education — AI Literacy Curriculum
1. **Structural:** define competencies  
2. **Contextual:** adapt to learners  
3. **Integrative:** simulate classrooms  
4. **Reflective:** audit fairness

### Healthcare — AI-Assisted Triage
1. codify guidelines 2. model constraints 3. integrate data 4. evaluate ethics

Each illustrates context-sensitive reasoning across all four layers.

## 6. Project Roadmap

| Phase | Objective | Status |
|-------|------------|--------|
| 1 | Theoretical foundation, public docs | 🔴 Active |
| 2 | Community case studies, tooling | 🟡 Preparing |
| 3 | Open collaboration & cross-cultural validation | 🟢 Planned |

Deliverables: full documentation, four-layer model, pilot EHS validation.

## 7. Ethical Position

- Independent, vendor-neutral research  
- Academic fair-use of model names  
- Emphasis on transparency, accountability, cognitive diversity  
- Rejection of techno-solutionism: human judgment remains final authority
