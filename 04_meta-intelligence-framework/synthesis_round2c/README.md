# Synthesis Round 2C  
**Independent Meta-Syntheses by Model (Round 2C)**  
**Author:** Kiyoshi Sasano | **Date:** October 2025

## Overview

Round 2C captures each model’s *independent meta-synthesis* of all others’  
self-reflections. Each model was asked to integrate and interpret cross-model  
meta-cognition *without direct coordination*.

This phase reveals how distinct architectures converge or diverge  
in their interpretation of epistemic universals.

## Methodological Notes

- Each synthesis was produced using identical instructions and format.  
- Self-referential bias was restricted (no direct self-comparison).  
- The purpose is to *observe interpretive parallax* — how each model’s  
  perception of others encodes its own epistemic stance.

## Transition to Round 2D

Round 2D builds upon these independent syntheses  
to produce a **unified meta-synthesis** — the ensemble-level reflection.  

See `../synthesis_round2d/README.md` for integration methods.
