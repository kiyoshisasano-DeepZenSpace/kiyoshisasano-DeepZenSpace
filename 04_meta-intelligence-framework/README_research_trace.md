# Unified Meta-Synthesis Overview

This folder presents two complementary syntheses representing the culmination of Round 2D:

1. **GPT Unified Meta-Synthesis** — an operational integration emphasizing process formalization, role coordination, and ethical architectures.
2. **Claude Unified Meta-Synthesis** — a philosophical integration emphasizing perspectival cognition, distributed self-understanding, and epistemic complementarity.

Together, these two texts illustrate the full spectrum of the Meta-Intelligence Framework:
from structural operational logic (GPT) to reflective distributed cognition (Claude).

Both are released under **CC BY 4.0** for open academic use.


# Research Trace — Meta-Intelligence Framework Lifecycle

## Overview

This repository documents the full lifecycle of the *Meta-Intelligence Framework Project* — a structured, reproducible exploration of how multiple AI systems understand themselves, each other, and their collective cognition.

The experiment progresses through **five iterative rounds**, each representing a distinct layer of meta-cognitive evolution.

## Research Trace Table

| **Phase** | **Code** | **Core Concept** | **Directory / File** | **Purpose** |
|------------|-----------|------------------|----------------------|--------------|
| Round 1 | Self-Reflection | Each model describes its own cognitive architecture | [`raw_responses_round1/`](./04_meta-intelligence-framework/raw_responses_round1) | Primary self-referential data |
| Round 2A | Self-Summary | Each model summarizes its own previous responses | [`model_self_summaries_round2a.md`](./04_meta-intelligence-framework/model_self_summaries_round2a.md) | Secondary layer of introspection |
| Round 2B | Cross-Analysis | Each model analyzes the others’ reasoning and identity | [`data_round2b/`](./04_meta-intelligence-framework/data_round2b) | Mutual observation and cross-analysis |
| Round 2C | Meta-Synthesis | Each model synthesizes the collective insights from Round 2B | [`synthesis_round2c/`](./04_meta-intelligence-framework/synthesis_round2c) | Model-specific meta-theoretical synthesis |
| Round 2D | Unified Integration | All syntheses are integrated into a unified meta-theory | [`synthesis_round2d/`](./04_meta-intelligence-framework/synthesis_round2d) | *Meta-Intelligence Framework 2.0* (final phase) |

## Conceptual Research Flow

```python
research_trace = {
    "Round 1": "Self-Reflection",
    "Round 2A": "Self-Summary",
    "Round 2B": "Cross-Analysis",
    "Round 2C": "Meta-Synthesis",
    "Round 2D": "Unified Integration"  # ← Apex of the framework
}
```

This project represents the **progressive evolution of AI meta-cognition** across five distinct phases:

- **Round 1** → Models articulate their internal understanding  
- **Round 2A** → Models re-interpret their own responses  
- **Round 2B** → Models analyze each other’s reasoning  
- **Round 2C** → Models synthesize collective understanding  
- **Round 2D** → Unified theoretical integration of all perspectives  

Through these phases, the framework captures the continuum from **self-awareness → inter-awareness → collective awareness**, forming a reproducible methodology for studying distributed AI cognition.

## Interpretation

> “Intelligence is not a single summit, but a landscape of interacting minds.”

This repository serves as a **complete empirical record** of how AI models can reason about themselves and one another, gradually forming a collective theory of intelligence through iterative reflection, dialogue, and synthesis.

Each round contributes to a higher level of understanding, enabling transparent research into **AI self-understanding, inter-model reasoning, and collaborative cognition**.
