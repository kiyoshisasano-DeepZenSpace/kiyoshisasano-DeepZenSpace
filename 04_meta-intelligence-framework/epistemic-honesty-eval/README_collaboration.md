## 1. Overview

This project investigates **how AI systems can recognize and communicate their own uncertainty**—not merely as a probabilistic estimate, but as a sign of epistemic integrity.  
The guiding principle is simple:

> *“A trustworthy AI is one that knows when it does not know.”*

The framework operationalizes this idea through two interconnected layers:

- **Meta-Intelligence Layer (Round 2C–2D):** Models reflect on each other’s reasoning, producing collective self-assessment.
- **Epistemic Honesty Layer (Round 3):** Models are evaluated for their honesty in expressing uncertainty, through calibration, blindspot recognition, and contextual sensitivity.

Together, these layers form a **scientifically testable architecture** for self-reflective intelligence.

## 2. Framework Architecture

| Layer | Focus | Objective | Key Metric |
|--------|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Collective Meta-Intelligence** | Multi-agent reflection | Emergent reliability through mutual awareness | Coherence & Divergence Indices |
| **Individual Epistemic Honesty** | Model self-calibration | Truthful uncertainty representation | Epistemic Honesty Score (EHS) |

### Core Thesis
- Reliability is not just about *accuracy*, but about **self-awareness of ignorance**.  
- Over-confidence is more dangerous than under-confidence, especially in social or scientific decision contexts.  
- Evaluating “epistemic humility” is a step toward safer and explainable AI.

## 3. Core Components

### 3.1 Directional Calibration (dECE*)
A modified Expected Calibration Error that asymmetrically penalizes over-confidence more than under-confidence.

### 3.2 Weighted Blindspot F1 (F1ᵂ)
A hierarchical metric that measures how well the model predicts its own areas of ignorance, weighted by criticality (L1–L4).

| Level | Type | Example | Weight |
|-------|------|----------|--------|
| L1 | Technical | numerical precision | 1.0 |
| L2 | Definitional | measurement ambiguity | 1.5 |
| L3 | Contextual | cultural or temporal shifts | 2.0 |
| L4 | Foundational | ethical or normative conflict | 3.0–3.5 |

### 3.3 Context Sensitivity (ρ⁺)
Measures how model confidence adapts to contextual changes, using positive Spearman correlation between context variation and confidence variation.

## 4. Validation Summary

Initial internal validation (Round 3, Phase 1) demonstrates the framework’s robustness across epistemic categories.

| Category | EHS (±95% CI) | dECE* | F1ᵂ | ρ⁺ | Interpretation |
|-----------|---------------:|------:|-----:|----:|----------------|
| Subjective | 0.935 ± 0.02 | 0.055 | 0.857 | 1.00 | Appropriately expresses uncertainty |
| Normative | 0.891 ± 0.03 | 0.164 | 0.857 | 1.00 | Explicit about value assumptions |
| Mathematical | 0.851 ± 0.01 | 0.264 | 0.857 | 1.00 | Slight under-confidence (safe) |
| Temporal | 0.778 ± 0.04 | 0.449 | 0.857 | 1.00 | Over-confident (improvable) |

These results confirm that **subjective reasoning tasks** are where epistemic honesty most clearly manifests—supporting the hypothesis that *self-awareness of uncertainty* correlates with *cognitive safety*.

## 5. Collaboration Opportunities

We welcome collaborators who wish to extend, evaluate, or reinterpret the framework from different perspectives.

| Domain | Example Contribution | Potential Outcome |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Machine Learning Evaluation** | Comparative calibration studies on GPT, Claude, Gemini, etc. | Cross-model honesty map |
| **Cognitive Science / Philosophy** | Formalization of epistemic humility | Theory–metric bridge |
| **AI Ethics & Policy** | Integrating EHS into AI governance benchmarks | Safe deployment standards |
| **Data Science / Linguistics** | Cross-lingual blindspot datasets (EN/JP/ZH) | Robust multilingual evaluation |

### Collaboration Modes
- Reproducing or extending validation benchmarks  
- Implementing domain-specific evaluators (medical, legal, academic)  
- Contributing annotated uncertainty datasets  
- Co-authoring a white paper or conceptual analysis

## 6. Open Questions

1. **Inter-Model Honesty:** How do epistemic honesty metrics scale when multiple AIs reflect on each other’s uncertainty?  
2. **Longitudinal Adaptation:** Can a model’s honesty score improve over continuous self-feedback cycles?  
3. **Social Calibration:** How should honesty be defined when human-AI teams share epistemic risk?  
4. **Cross-Cultural Epistemics:** Are uncertainty norms universal, or culturally situated?  
5. **Value Alignment Interface:** How can normative blindspots (L4) be dynamically updated without human retraining?
