# 📘 PLD Structural Scope and Conditions  
**Structural Monitoring Criteria for Timing-Aware Systems**  
**Version:** August 2025

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This document defines the **technical scope, structural preconditions, and non-applicable areas** for applying  
**Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)** as an interactional rhythm monitoring framework.

It is intended for:

- Implementation teams exploring latency-sensitive architectures  
- Research engineers conducting ambiguity-resilient PoC work  
- System architects evaluating rhythmic misalignment as a structural issue  

---

## ✅ Applicability Criteria

PLD is only structurally valid when **all** of the following conditions hold:

| Criterion                | Requirement |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| **Timing Sensitivity**     | Latency, delay, or silence is treated as a meaningful signal — not noise |
| **Pacing Impact**          | Interaction rhythm (e.g., turn timing, recursion) materially affects coherence |
| **Ambiguity Tolerance**    | Non-resolution is allowed as a functional system state |
| **Modular Isolation**      | PLD logic can operate without altering system outcomes or user goals |

If **any** of the following apply, PLD is **not** suitable:

- Fluency, completion, or speed is prioritized over rhythm  
- Outputs must be directive, resolved, or predictable  
- Timing holds no structural significance in implementation

> PLD is **not a UX enhancer** or **dialogue decorator**.  
> It is only applicable when rhythm is part of system logic.

## 🧠 Structural Drift Dimensions

PLD surfaces **interactional misalignments**, not failures.  
These are detected as **degradations of rhythm across layers**:

| Drift Axis          | Structural Signal |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Rhythmic Drift**     | Timing collapse, flattened latency, silence misuse |
| **Relational Drift**   | Premature closure, default persona fallback |
| **Semantic Drift**     | Topic compression, paraphrased recursion, meaning loss |

> Drift is **non-inferential** and multi-axial.  
> It reflects loss of interactional rhythm — not behavioral error.

---

## 🚫 Explicit Exclusions

PLD must **not** be used in:

- Safety-critical, medical, or regulatory decision systems  
- Optimization pipelines (e.g., reward tuning, personalization engines)  
- Behavioral profiling, affect detection, or therapeutic simulation  
- Systems intending to generate or simulate emotional trust

> PLD cannot be applied to **infer** emotion, state, or intent.  
> It is a structural sensor — not a predictive model.

---

## 🧪 Valid PoC Use Cases

PLD may be applied in **controlled, non-user-facing test environments** for:

- Measuring hesitation tolerance in dialogue agents  
- Simulating silence window calibration in handoff design  
- Tracking recursion pacing in ambiguous interaction flows  
- Observing rhythmic degradation in asynchronous loops

These uses are **diagnostic** — not directive.  
PLD must remain **structurally contained**, invisible to the end-user experience.

---

## ✅ Implementation Readiness Checklist

Confirm the following before integrating any PLD-aligned module:

- ☐ Latency, silence, or pause can be structurally interpreted  
- ☐ System allows ambiguous states to persist without resolution  
- ☐ Recursion can occur without forced content closure  
- ☐ No affect simulation or behavioral inference is applied  
- ☐ You have reviewed `pld_external_engagement_policy.md` and confirmed alignment

> PLD is not compatible with high-speed, deterministic, or outcome-optimized architectures.

---

## 🔐 Licensing & Reuse Conditions

PLD logic is governed under structural-use licensing. You must:

- Maintain rhythm-context integrity in all adaptations  
- Avoid symbolic, stylistic, or metaphorical repurposing  
- Attribute the original framework clearly (e.g., “Phase Loop Dynamics — Kiyoshi Sasano”)

> Simulating drift or latency **without grounding** in rhythm structure is prohibited.

---

## 📎 Closing Note

PLD is **not**:

- A UX method  
- A prompt pattern  
- A conversational template

It is a **structural observation lens**, designed for environments where rhythm integrity **matters systemically**.

> PLD does not interpret meaning.  
> It detects rhythm loss.

If rhythm is not part of your architecture — **do not apply PLD**.
