# 📘 PLD Structural Scope and Conditions  
**Structural Monitoring Criteria for Timing-Aware Systems**  
**Version:** August 2025

---

## 📌 Purpose

This document defines the **technical scope, conditions, and non-applicable areas** for applying  
**Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)** as a structural observation model in system design.

It is intended for implementation teams, system architects, and research engineers  
evaluating whether PLD is relevant for a given component or PoC context.

---

## ✅ Structural Applicability

PLD is relevant only when all of the following conditions apply:

| Criterion                  | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Timing Sensitivity         | The system must interpret **latency, delay, or silence** as meaningful input |
| Rhythm Implications        | Interaction **pacing or recursion** affects coherence or usability          |
| Ambiguity Tolerance        | The design supports **non-resolution** as a valid interaction state         |
| Modular Isolation          | PLD can be applied **without altering outcome logic or user goals**         |

PLD is **not applicable** if:

- The system prioritizes **fluency, throughput, or goal-completion**
- Outputs are required to be **final, complete, or directive**
- Structural rhythm has **no implementation-level significance**

---

## 🧠 Drift Dimensions

PLD identifies **interactional misalignment** (not failure) using structural signals.

| Drift Type        | Signal Source                                      |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Rhythmic Drift**   | Tempo irregularities, delay inconsistencies, silence misuse |
| **Relational Drift** | Breakdown in shared framing, premature closure    |
| **Semantic Drift**   | Unintended compression, topical repetition        |

> Drift is **cross-dimensional** and not error-based.  
> It represents degradation of rhythm, not logic.

---

## 🚫 Excluded Use Cases

Do **not** apply PLD in:

- Safety-critical, diagnostic, or regulatory systems  
- Behavioral profiling, optimization pipelines, or reward-driven agents  
- Simulated empathy, trust-building, or therapeutic claims  

PLD must never be used to **infer intention, emotion, or user state**.

---

## 📈 Use Case Examples (PoC Level)

- Testing hesitation tolerance in conversational agents  
- Simulating silence calibration in agent handoff logic  
- Observing pacing variance in ambiguity-rich tasks  
- Designing pause behavior in reflection or feedback modes  

These are **technical tests**, not product features.  
PLD is **non-directive** and never exposed directly to end users.

---

## ✅ Implementation Readiness Checklist

Before using PLD or drift-related tools, confirm the following:

- ☐ The system supports structural interpretation of **latency or pause**  
- ☐ Ambiguity is not immediately resolved by default logic  
- ☐ Recursion or withholding can occur without forced closure  
- ☐ No behavioral inference or emotion simulation is being applied  
- ☐ `pld_external_engagement_policy.md` has been reviewed and accepted  

> PLD is not suited for predictable, continuous-output, or deterministic environments.

## 📎 Licensing & Attribution

All PLD logic is licensed under structural-use terms:

- Reuse must preserve **rhythm-context integrity**  
- Partial extraction for symbolic or inferential logic is prohibited  
- Attribution is required in any modified or derived tooling

> Simulation of drift or latency without full structural grounding is **not permitted**.

---

## 🔚 Closing Statement

PLD is not a method, interface, or optimization pattern.  
It is a **structural diagnostic lens**, applicable only when interaction rhythm is a technical factor.

> It does not interpret meaning.  
> It detects when rhythm no longer aligns.

Use PLD to **observe, not control**.  
When in doubt — exclude it.
