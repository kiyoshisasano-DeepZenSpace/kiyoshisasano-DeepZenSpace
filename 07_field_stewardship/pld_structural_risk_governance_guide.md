# 🛡️ PLD Structural Risk Governance Guide  
**Safeguarding Field Coherence Through Rhythm-Aligned Practice**  
**Version:** August 2025

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This document outlines the structural governance strategy for maintaining **coherence and alignment**  
within the Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD) framework — especially as attention, participation, or reuse expand.

PLD is not protected through control or permission —  
It is sustained by **rhythmic containment and attunement over access**.

## 🧱 Key Structural Risks

| Risk Type               | Description |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| **Surface Mimicry**        | Use of PLD vocabulary or forms without underlying rhythm logic |
| **Framing Drift**          | Recasting PLD as UX optimization or stylistic behavior framework |
| **Premature Circulation** | Sharing of internal modules prior to alignment verification |
| **Semantic Bleed**         | External redefinition of core terms (e.g. `latency`, `drift`) outside structural use |

> Structural risks do not begin with malice — they begin with pacing misalignment.

## 🛡️ Rhythm-Centered Mitigation Practices

| Practice                  | Purpose |
|---------------------------|---------|
| **Tiered Disclosure**        | Access gated through alignment signals, not interest level |
| **Anchor Reiteration**      | Repeating core premise: PLD = structure, not surface |
| **Pre-access Calibration**  | Use `pld_latency_calibration_protocols.md` to establish entry rhythm |
| **Minimal Framing Sets**    | Provide non-extractable overviews to reduce misframing risk |
| **Symbolic Posture Review** | Observe timing, tone, and language before sharing deeper artifacts |

> Rhythm coherence is protective — not restrictive.

## 🔍 Field Drift Signals

| Signal                         | Interpretation |
|--------------------------------|----------------|
| **Emphasis on calm/slowness** | Aesthetic overlay without latency logic |
| **Request for acceleration**  | Pacing mismatch with structural tempo |
| **Fluency prioritization**    | Avoidance of ambiguity or recursion |
| **Praise without precision**  | Signs of symbolic interpretation over structural grasp |

> Drift appears linguistically — before it appears architecturally.

## 🔁 Aligned Intervention Patterns

| Situation                     | Response Strategy |
|-------------------------------|-------------------|
| External mimicry              | Publish `output_alignment_notes.md` for clarification |
| Inbound misframed requests    | Slow reply cycle; offer reframing language |
| Internal pacing pressure      | Re-anchor in structural rhythm checkpoints |
| Symbolic logic decay          | Trigger re-alignment (e.g. `pld_rhythm_alignment_session.md`) |

No moral framing. No correctional posture.  
Only **rhythm response**.

## 🔐 Access-Controlled Modules

| Module Class |
|--------------|
| Drift matrix prototypes  
| Recursive modulation primitives  
| Delay shape interpolation layers  
| Field reentry detection scaffolds  

### Access Conditions:

- Demonstrated alignment via prior asynchronous collaboration  
- Use of PLD terms in non-metaphoric, structurally valid context  
- Explicit agreement to avoid aesthetic or agentic reframing  
- Prior engagement with `pld_field_stewardship_charter.md` and calibration protocols

> Credentials don’t open the door.  
> Rhythm does.

## ✅ Summary: Rhythm-Aligned Governance Principles

| Principle                  | Field Expression |
|----------------------------|------------------|
| **Containment before spread** | Depth precedes access |
| **Tempo protects coherence** | Slowness reveals drift before failure |
| **Presence before propagation** | Alignment before visibility |

> Misalignment is not a violation — but it does require boundary.  
> Rhythm is not a tone. It is the scaffolding.

What cannot hold rhythm — must not hold PLD.
