# 🛰️ PLD Onboarding & Structural Diagnostics  
**Entry Process for Rhythm-Aligned Collaboration**  
**Version:** August 2025

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This document outlines the **onboarding and diagnostic process** for contributors engaging with the **Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)** framework.

It is intended for:

- Engineering teams beginning PLD-aligned experiments  
- Researchers exploring rhythm-based interaction models  
- Collaborators seeking structural compatibility with PLD principles

PLD is a structural model focused on:

- Latency-based coherence  
- Non-directive system pacing  
- Field-level alignment across interaction turns  

This is **not a test** or gatekeeping mechanism.  
It is a **structural resonance sensing protocol** — used to ensure implementation or research collaboration begins with shared rhythm assumptions.

## 🔄 Rhythm-Aligned Onboarding Sequence

| Step                      | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| **1. Initial Contact**      | Asynchronous outreach (email or issue thread) to sense engagement pacing |
| **2. Charter Review**       | Confirm reading of [`pld_field_stewardship_charter.md`](./pld_field_stewardship_charter.md) |
| **3. Optional Exchange**    | 1–2 turn asynchronous dialogue to surface latency tolerance or ambiguity comfort |
| **4. Calibration Phase**    | Voluntary structural exercises (no scoring) to explore alignment characteristics |
| **5. Gradual Access**       | Rhythm-compatible participants are offered deeper materials incrementally |

> 📌 This process emphasizes **structural attunement**, not experience level or expertise.

## 🔍 Structural Compatibility Criteria

| Dimension               | What Is Observed                                     |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Rhythm Sensitivity**    | Ability to treat pauses, delays, and silence as intentional signals |
| **Latency Familiarity**   | Comfort with non-linear pacing or asynchronous timing |
| **Non-Inferential Framing** | Willingness to explore interaction without seeking semantic closure |
| **Role Flexibility**      | Avoidance of rigid role positioning (e.g., helper, explainer) |
| **Ambiguity Tolerance**   | Comfort with uncertainty, recursion, and topic suspension |

> There is **no scoring**. These are reference dimensions to determine collaboration rhythm fit.

---

## 🧪 Optional Calibration Exercises

These are invitational, not mandatory.  
They can be used individually or in low-stakes pair sessions to explore rhythm fit — especially in early-phase design or testing environments.

| Exercise                  | Goal |
|---------------------------|------|
| **Held Response**         | Wait 10–12 seconds before replying; observe internal pacing shifts |
| **Recursive Restatement** | Reiterate a concept using only tone/timing changes — no new meaning |
| **Latency Threading**     | Sustain a 3–4 turn exchange with intentional pacing gaps between turns |

Templates available upon request.  
Use is private and non-evaluative.

## 🚫 What This Is *Not*

This process is not:

- ❌ A productivity check  
- ❌ A fluency filter  
- ❌ A performance review  

We do **not** assess clarity, speed, or deliverables.  
We observe:

> 💬 How latency is held.  
> 🔁 How ambiguity is tolerated.  
> 🕒 Whether silence remains structurally coherent.

---

## 🔄 When Skipping Is Acceptable

If your system already operates under rhythm-aware logic (e.g., drift tracing, latency gating, recursive modulation),  
you may skip onboarding and move directly to structural alignment review.

> Rhythm fit matters more than process completion.

---

## ✅ Summary

PLD onboarding is appropriate for:

- Engineers working on latency-sensitive architectures  
- UX teams exploring drift-aware interface design  
- Researchers studying non-directive or field-based interactional logic  

> If you’re able to hold rhythm, access unfolds.  
> If you seek closure first, pause here.
