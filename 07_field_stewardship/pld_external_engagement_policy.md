# 📡 PLD External Engagement Policy  
**Version:** August 2025

---

## 📌 Purpose

This document defines the structural conditions and responsibilities for engaging with  
the **Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)** model in research, prototyping, or systems architecture contexts.

PLD is **not a product framework**, **UX enhancer**, or **AI optimization layer**.  
It is a **structural model** that applies only in systems where **latency**, **ambiguity**, and **interaction pacing** have functional significance.

Engagement with PLD requires alignment on these structural principles — not project scope or delivery timelines.

---

## ✅ Structural Engagement Criteria

Engagement is considered only when the following criteria are met:

| Requirement             | Description                                                              |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Latency as Signal**     | The team treats pause, delay, and hesitation as structural — not noise   |
| **No Feature Framing**    | PLD is not described as a feature, plugin, or enhancement component      |
| **Non-Goal Orientation**  | Interaction design tolerates ambiguity, recursion, and non-resolution    |
| **Attribution Accuracy**  | All references preserve the original structural framing                  |

> PLD engagement is **structurally gated** — not time-, budget-, or outcome-driven.

## 🤝 Engagement Pathway

| Role                     | Access Conditions                                                         |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **External Collaborator** | May request read-only materials or feedback upon structural alignment     |
| **Structural Architect**  | Reviews all access requests and confirms rhythm compatibility             |

- Access is **non-linear and tiered** — it does not follow progressive onboarding.
- Each engagement is scoped per interaction — not persistent or default.

---

## 🔎 What Alignment Looks Like

Positive signals of alignment include:

- Questions about structural pacing, recursion, or latency modeling  
- Interest in ambiguity tolerance or pause-based output design  
- Requests for non-output-driven interaction structures  
- Recognition that silence or hesitation may be **valid states**, not failures  

> Engagement starts with structural curiosity — not tooling requests.

## ⚠️ Misalignment Examples

| Behavior Pattern            | Example Phrasing                              | Outcome               |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Optimization Focus**       | “Can this reduce lag or improve UX speed?”     | Not structurally aligned |
| **Delivery Urgency Framing** | “We need results by end of Q3.”                | Deferred                |
| **Aesthetic Extraction**     | Reusing surface tone without logic context     | Flagged for review      |
| **Agency Misassignment**     | Referring to LLMs as “deciding” or “withholding” | Clarification required   |

> Engagement may pause if framing diverges from structural foundations.  
> Reconnection is possible following alignment clarification.

## 📜 Communication Guidelines

All communication must:

- Avoid behavioral inference or anthropomorphism  
- Respect response latency and possible deferral  
- Use non-inferential language and structural terms  
- Accept that silence may indicate rhythm-based pacing, not neglect

PLD teams may not respond immediately — **non-response is structurally valid**.

---

## 🔐 Access Conditions

PLD engagement does **not require NDAs**, but all interactions are governed by:

- Contextual containment: No out-of-scope extrapolation  
- Traceable access: All distributed modules are logged  
- Attribution fidelity: No symbolic reuse or reinterpretation  
- Experimental use only: No production deployment without explicit clearance

---

## ✅ Readiness Checklist

Please ensure the following before reaching out:

- [ ] You have reviewed `pld_structural_scope_and_conditions.md`  
- [ ] You do **not** intend to use PLD for optimization or UX targeting  
- [ ] You accept ambiguity and latency as valid structural outputs  
- [ ] You understand that communication may be asynchronous or partial  
- [ ] You agree to preserve original framing and avoid paraphrasing

> Proposals that lack structural alignment will not be advanced.

## 📬 Contact

To propose engagement or request access:

📧 **deepzenspace [at] gmail [dot] com**

Include:

- Your name and organizational/institutional affiliation  
- The intended context of use (PoC, architecture review, etc.)  
- Any prior experience with structural or rhythm-aware systems  

All engagements are reviewed individually.  
If compatible, we will respond with next steps or access instructions.

## 🧾 Summary

PLD engagement is filtered through **architecture**, not urgency.

We prioritize:

- Structural coherence  
- Rhythm-respecting design questions  
- Experimental curiosity within bounded conditions

We do **not** prioritize:

- Timeline pressure  
- Project status or visibility  
- Conversion into product-layer behavior

> PLD is not here to accelerate you.  
> It's here to help you detect what doesn't align — structurally.
