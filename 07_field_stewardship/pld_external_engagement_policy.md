# 📡 PLD External Engagement Policy  
**Version:** August 2025

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This document defines the engagement protocol for individuals or teams seeking to collaborate with the **Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)** project.

PLD is **not a product framework or enhancement layer**. It is a structural interaction model focused on:

- Latency-aware presence and responsiveness  
- Ambiguity-coherent pacing  
- Rhythm-based, non-directive system behavior  

Engagement with PLD is governed by **rhythmic and structural alignment**, not transactional logic or delivery timelines.

---

## 🔐 Structural Access Requirements

Engagement is permitted only when the following conditions are satisfied:

| Criterion               | Requirement                                                                 |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Rhythm Awareness**     | Understand latency and timing as functional components, not side effects     |
| **No Feature Framing**   | Do not present PLD as a UX, AI, or branding optimization                     |
| **Pacing over Timelines** | Prioritize field readiness above deadlines or deliverables                   |
| **Contextual Attribution** | All references must preserve structural framing and original semantics       |

> ⚠️ Engagement begins **only** after these structural alignments are verified.  
> Misaligned framing (e.g., speed-first, performance-driven) pauses all collaboration.

## 🧱 Roles and Boundaries

| Role                    | Scope of Engagement                                                              |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **External Collaborator** | May request materials or feedback, under structural alignment                    |
| **Field Architect**      | Maintains rhythm integrity and approves access at each tier                      |

- Access is **tiered**, not progressive.  
- Each request is evaluated independently and may be revoked upon misalignment.

---

## ⚠️ Common Misalignments

| Misalignment Type     | Example Statement                                  | Response    |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Output Optimization** | “We want to reduce latency for smoother UX.”       | Rejected    |
| **Schedule Framing**    | “We need this integrated by end of quarter.”       | Deferred    |
| **Aesthetic Extraction**| Using tone/styling without structural logic        | Flagged     |
| **Agent Misprojection** | Attributing design agency to LLMs or GPTs          | Disengaged  |

All misaligned cases result in **access suspension**.  
Re-engagement requires formal rhythm verification.

## ✅ Structural Alignment Criteria

| Requirement               | Description                                                                    |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Interpretive Precision** | Can distinguish between semantic content and interaction rhythm                |
| **Temporal Flexibility**   | Accepts non-linear pacing, including silence and deferral                      |
| **Respect for Boundaries** | Does not request premature access to incomplete or gated modules               |
| **Protocol Agreement**     | Communicates via non-inferential, rhythm-aligned channels                      |

> Silence ≠ neglect.  
> Timing in PLD is structural, not functional.

---

## 🔒 Access Control Principles

PLD does **not** require NDAs. However, access is governed by:

- Structural containment boundaries  
- Selective sharing of experimental modules (e.g., latency scoring, drift logic)  
- Logging of all granted access for traceability  
- Attribution fidelity — **no symbolic reuse without alignment**

---

## ✅ Engagement Readiness Checklist

Ensure **all** of the following before initiating contact:

- Read `pld_essence_and_definitions.md`  
- No intent to frame PLD as an AI/UX enhancement layer  
- Acceptance of ambiguity, silence, and delay as valid outputs  
- Agreement that communication may be deferred or unreciprocated  
- No abstraction, paraphrasing, or transformation of provided materials

> Submissions lacking coherence with these conditions will not receive a reply.

## 📬 Contact

Initial inquiries should be sent to:

📧 **deepzenspace [at] gmail [dot] com**

Please include:

- Name and institutional or organizational affiliation  
- Purpose of engagement and intended scope  
- Experience with rhythm-sensitive or ambiguity-tolerant systems  

Responses are discretionary.  
Engagement proceeds **only** if rhythm compatibility is established.

---

## 🧾 Summary

PLD engagement does **not** prioritize:

- Project prestige  
- Timeline urgency  
- Budget or resourcing

Instead, engagement is filtered through:

- Structural coherence  
- Latency-aware architectural thinking  
- Willingness to operate outside of optimization logic

> PLD is an architectural model — not a toolset.  
> Presence is not performance.  
> Participation requires rhythm, not velocity.
