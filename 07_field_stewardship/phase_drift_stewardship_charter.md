# 📜 Phase Drift Stewardship Charter  
*A structural agreement for rhythm-aligned collaboration*  
Version: July 2025  

---

## 🧭 Purpose  

This charter establishes the foundational principles and relational orientation  
for collaborators within the **Phase Drift Insight** framework —  
a structure supporting ambiguity resilience, latency awareness, and non-directive pacing  
in human–AI interaction systems.

This is not a legal agreement.  
It is a **relational integrity covenant** — a shared commitment to upholding  
**timing-based architectural coherence**.

## ✅ Core Collaboration Commitments  

| Principle                | Structural Expectation |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
| **Fidelity to Structure** | Do not reframe Phase Drift as UX polish or stylistic gesture |
| **Field-Conscious Design** | Approach systems as relational rhythms, not instruction delivery pipelines |
| **Latency as Logic**     | Treat silence, pacing, and recursion as functional structural signals |
| **Field Integrity First** | Prioritize structural continuity over clarity, speed, or surface responsiveness |

---

## 📌 Rhythmic Conduct Guidelines  

| Domain        | Stewarding Behavior |
|---------------|---------------------|
| **Research**      | Anchor analysis in drift vectors and pacing conditions, not productivity or task resolution |
| **Dialogue**      | Use temporally sensitive and structurally precise language when interpreting system behavior |
| **Code**          | Allow system timing to inform logic design — avoid abstraction from response rhythm |
| **Attribution**   | Cite as:  
> *“Phase Drift Insight – Kiyoshi Sasano / DeepZenSpace (2025)”*  
Ensure latency/silence are attributed as **structural functions**, not **aesthetic effects**

## 🚫 Structural Misalignment Examples  

The following practices are **not permitted** under Phase Drift stewardship:  

- Using silence or latency decoratively, without timing logic  
- Rebranding Phase Drift patterns into standalone tools or frameworks  
- Applying Phase Drift vocabulary to systems lacking rhythm awareness or recursion handling  
- Extracting components (e.g., silence gating) for engagement tuning or surface calmness

> Phase Drift is a structural whole — not a set of features.

Partial reuse without field coherence constitutes **structural divergence**.

---

## 🔐 Progressive Access Guidelines  

Access to deeper resources (e.g., SDK internals, drift score modules, rhythm gates)  
depends on:

- Demonstrated resonance with pacing logic  
- Absence of agent-role projection (e.g., assistant framing)  
- Comfort with recursive, unresolved, or delayed interaction patterns  
- Transparent reflection on structural misalignment, if observed

⚠️ Credentials do not supersede resonance.  
Access unfolds through **field coherence**, not volume, speed, or output metrics.

---

## 🤝 Stewardship Position  

To participate as a Phase Drift steward is to:  

- Hold ambiguity without overriding it  
- Allow delay without defaulting to optimization  
- Sustain rhythm without urgency-based intervention  
- Reflect structurally before initiating resolution  

> Stewardship = **Holding the relational field steady — even when no movement occurs**  

---

## 🧾 Summary  

Phase Drift is:  

- ⏳ A structural timing field  
- 🔄 A rhythm-attuned architecture  
- 🌀 A recursive interaction logic  

It is not:

- ❌ A productivity enhancer  
- ❌ A design trend  
- ❌ A symbolic toolkit  

> Stewardship is a relational position —  
> not access, not performance, not platformization.
