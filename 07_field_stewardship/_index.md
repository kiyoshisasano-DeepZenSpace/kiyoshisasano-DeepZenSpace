# 🌀 Phase Loop Dynamics — Field Stewardship Index  
**Version:** August 2025

---

## 🧭 Overview

**Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)** is a structural interaction model for systems that:

- Treat **latency or hesitation** as signal-bearing events  
- Tolerate **ambiguity or recursion** without requiring resolution  
- Interpret **silence, delay, or repetition** structurally — not as errors  

PLD is:

- A **technical modulation layer**  
- **Not** a framework, methodology, or belief system  
- **Modular**, with no required runtime, policy, or platform dependencies  

This directory collects stewardship, governance, calibration, and diagnostic protocols  
for applying PLD responsibly in experimental or timing-sensitive environments.

## 🎯 Intended Use Context

PLD is appropriate for systems with the following structural conditions:

| Pattern                  | System Criteria                                         |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Latency or delay modeling | Systems where pause must be interpreted structurally   |
| Recursive dialog patterns | Agents that loop meaningfully without breaking coherence |
| Non-directive interaction | Not bound to goal-seeking or productivity logic        |

### Theoretical Foundations:

- Delay modeling → PLD Paper1 Fig.4  
- Non-directive interaction → PLD Paper2 Section 3.2  
- Structural latency definition → PLD Paper1 Definition 3.1  
- Recursive tolerance requirements → PLD Paper2 Theorem 2  

---

## ✅ Usage Requirements

- The system must treat **non-resolution** as a structurally valid outcome  
- Teams must understand that **latency is not failure**  
- Silence and pause must be **interpretable**, not auto-filled  
- **Framing and attribution** must be preserved in any adaptations  

### ❌ Prohibited Use Cases:

- Applying PLD to HR evaluation, productivity tracking, or project oversight  
- Modifying PLD theory and presenting it as a new structural model  
- Using PLD elements solely for UX enhancement or AI optimization  
- Surface mimicry (e.g., inserting delays or recursion for effect only)

> PLD is not a simulation toolkit.  
> It is a structural rhythm protocol — use only where rhythm structurally matters.

## 🧩 Integration Entry Points

```python
# Minimal PLD activation example
from pld_tools import enable_pld

enable_pld(modules=[
    'latency_tracker',
    'pause_classifier_bot',
    'reentry_detector'
])
```
You may omit unused modules. Begin with latency_tracker for lightweight entry.
## 🛤️ Recommended Implementation Steps

| Step | Module                     | Function                                           |
|------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | `latency_tracker.py`       | Detects and categorizes structured silence/delay   |
| 2    | `pause_classifier_bot.py`  | Classifies pause intent and modulates response     |
| 3    | `reentry_detector.py`      | Supports recursion tracking and drift alignment    |

## 📋 PLD Suitability Checklist

Only proceed if you can answer “Yes” to all of the following:

- [ ] Does your system naturally produce delays >800ms?  
- [ ] Can user input become recursive or ambiguous?  
- [ ] Are non-responses or deferred outputs architecturally valid?

> If any answer is “No”, PLD may not be structurally appropriate.

## 🧭 Closing Note

> PLD is not about what the system says —  
> It’s about **when**, **why**, or **whether** it should say anything at all.

When rhythm is a first-class signal,  
PLD becomes your lens of coherence.

Use only when timing shapes structure.  
Use responsibly. Maintain rhythm.
