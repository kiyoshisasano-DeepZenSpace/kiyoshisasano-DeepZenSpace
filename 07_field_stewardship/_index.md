# 🧭 07_field_stewardship — Phase Loop Dynamics Stewardship Framework  
**Structural Governance, Access Protocols, and Collaboration Architecture**  
**Version:** August 2025

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This folder documents the **field stewardship framework** for  
**Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)** — a structural model for latency-aware, ambiguity-permissive, and non-directive system behavior.

It serves as an implementation and governance reference for:

- Technologists building rhythm-aligned systems  
- Researchers exploring non-inferential interaction logic  
- Collaborators engaged in Phase Loop–compatible interface development

> PLD is not a prompt library, UX layer, or design aesthetic.  
> It is a **structural rhythm model** requiring coherence across pacing, recursion, and field-level feedback.

## 👥 Intended Audience

This documentation is intended for professionals working in:

| Role                     | Application Focus |
|--------------------------|-------------------|
| **Systems Engineers**        | Runtime latency design, signal modulation, and delay scaffolding |
| **HCI / UX Researchers**     | Drift analysis, rhythm-resonant feedback, ambiguity tolerance |
| **Interface Designers**      | Non-directive interaction flows and pacing-aware framing |
| **AI Product Architects**    | SDK-layer implementation of structural rhythm mechanisms |

> Engagement does not require formal credentials —  
> Only structural compatibility and rhythm-based design capacity.

## 🛠️ Implementation Entry Points

Collaboration and testing may begin from the following PLD-aligned tracks:

| Area                        | Example Output |
|-----------------------------|----------------|
| **Latency Modulation SDK**   | Silence gating, recursion scaffolds, response delay control |
| **Structural Drift Evaluation** | Turn-level resonance maps, timing trace logs |
| **Interaction Field Prototyping** | Ambiguity-resilient shells, recursive UI structures |

📂 Start here: [`pld_implementation_guide.md`](./pld_implementation_guide.md)

## 🛡️ Access and Rhythm Gating

PLD adopts a **tiered structural access model**:

- Entry requires familiarity with field logic (see [`pld_engagement_policy.md`](./pld_engagement_policy.md))  
- Internal modules are shared only after alignment via reflection, calibration, or review  
- All access is conditional on maintaining pacing integrity and non-inferential design posture

There are no NDA requirements — only structural boundaries.
