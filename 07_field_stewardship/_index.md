# 🌀 Phase Loop Dynamics — Field Stewardship Index  
**Version:** August 2025

---

## 🧭 Overview

**Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)** is a structural interaction model for systems that:

- Treat **latency or hesitation** as signal-bearing events  
- Tolerate **ambiguity or recursion** without requiring resolution  
- Interpret **silence, delay, or repetition** structurally — not as errors  

PLD is:

- A **technical modulation layer**  
- **Not** a framework, methodology, or belief system  
- **Modular**, with no required runtime, policy, or platform dependencies  

This directory collects stewardship, governance, calibration, and diagnostic protocols  
for applying PLD responsibly in experimental or timing-sensitive environments.

## 🎯 Intended Use Context

PLD is appropriate for systems with the following structural conditions:

| Pattern                  | System Criteria                                         |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Latency or delay modeling | Systems where pause must be interpreted structurally   |
| Recursive dialog patterns | Agents that loop meaningfully without breaking coherence |
| Non-directive interaction | Not bound to goal-seeking or productivity logic        |

### Theoretical Foundations:

- Delay modeling → PLD Paper1 Fig.4  
- Non-directive interaction → PLD Paper2 Section 3.2  
- Structural latency definition → PLD Paper1 Definition 3.1  
- Recursive tolerance requirements → PLD Paper2 Theorem 2

## ✅ Usage Requirements

- The system must treat **non-resolution** as a structurally valid outcome  
- Teams must understand that **latency is not failure**  
- Silence and pause must be **interpretable**, not auto-filled  
- **Framing and attribution** must be preserved in any adaptations  

### ❌ Prohibited Use Cases:

- Applying PLD to HR evaluation, productivity tracking, or project oversight  
- Modifying PLD theory and presenting it as a new structural model  
- Using PLD elements solely for UX enhancement or AI optimization  
- Surface mimicry (e.g., inserting delays or recursion for effect only)

> PLD is not a simulation toolkit.  
> It is a structural rhythm protocol — use only where rhythm structurally matters.
