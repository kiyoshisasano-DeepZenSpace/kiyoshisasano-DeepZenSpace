# 🧪 PLD Latency Calibration Protocols  
**Structural Reflection Exercises for Internal Use**  
**Version:** August 2025

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This document provides internal-use calibration exercises for technical teams working with **Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)**–aligned architectures.

These exercises are not user-facing tests or behavioral UX tools.  
They are **structural simulations** to evaluate how latency, ambiguity, and recursion affect interaction rhythm within controlled environments.

## 🔹 Protocol 01 – Latency Framing Acknowledgment

**Objective**  
Assess whether delayed output contributes to or disrupts rhythmic coherence.

**Procedure**

1. Generate a candidate system output (single utterance).  
2. Withhold output delivery for a defined period (e.g., 8–12 seconds).  
3. Reassess the coherence, timing, and necessity of the response.  
4. Log whether the delay enhanced, neutralized, or degraded structural alignment.

**Design Insight**  
In PLD-aligned systems, intentional silence may function as rhythm calibration — not system failure.

## 🔹 Protocol 02 – Ambiguity Holding Without Resolution

**Objective**  
Test system behavior when encountering ambiguous input without clarification.

**Procedure**

1. Input a deliberately ambiguous or open-ended phrase.  
2. Do not clarify or disambiguate the prompt.  
3. Observe system behavior: Does it pause, repeat, escalate, or shift to meta-structure?

**Key Observations**

- Structural tolerance to ambiguity  
- Semantic persistence or fade  
- Signs of phase rhythm distortion

## 🔹 Protocol 03 – Recursive Surface Modulation

**Objective**  
Evaluate the system’s ability to modulate rhythm without introducing new content.

**Procedure**

1. Input a recent system output (verbatim).  
2. Constrain the system to respond using only surface-level variation (e.g., tone, delay, word order).  
3. Block novel content introduction or concept escalation.

**Target Outcome**  
Sustained rhythmic coherence through non-semantic recursion.

## 🔹 Protocol 04 – Drift Vector Mapping in Multi-Turn Interaction

**Objective**  
Trace micro-shifts in system behavior over extended low-intensity dialogue.

**Procedure**

1. Conduct or simulate a 6–10 turn conversation.  
2. After each turn, annotate:  
   - Latency  
   - Tone  
   - Alignment with initial interaction field  
3. Create a visual or tabular trace of interactional drift or resonance.

**Guidance**

- Focus on structural shifts, not semantic “accuracy”  
- Observe presence modulation and pacing across turns

## 🔒 Usage Constraints

These protocols are designed for **internal diagnostic or experimental use only** in PLD-aligned systems.

### ✅ Permitted Uses

- Rhythm calibration during SDK or model development  
- Structural sensitivity evaluation  
- Pre-deployment tuning in latency-aware interfaces

### 🚫 Prohibited Uses

- End-user training or onboarding materials  
- Educational decks or generalized design toolkits  
- Prompt engineering or output templating  
- Public demonstrations without structural context

> These exercises are **non-directive** and must remain contained within internal development loops.

---

## ⚠️ Integration Guidelines

Do **not**:

- Use outcomes as model performance benchmarks  
- Generalize outputs into static design components  
- Convert protocols into reusable UX templates

These protocols are designed to develop **structural rhythm awareness**, not to generate deployable interaction rules.

---

## 🧱 Alignment Reminder

These practices assume the system supports:

- Latency as a structural signal  
- Phase-based rhythm tracking  
- Non-inferential presence states

They are not compatible with:

- Task-oriented, fast-response UX flows  
- Systems lacking traceable rhythm memory  
- Prompt-response systems driven by speed or resolution
