# 🧪 PLD Latency Calibration Protocols  
**Internal Structural Reflection Exercises**  
**Version:** August 2025

---

## 📌 Purpose

This document provides a set of **internal calibration protocols**  
for teams implementing or evaluating **Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)** architectures.

These protocols are intended to assess how latency, recursion, and ambiguity affect interaction rhythm.  
They are **not performance tests** and must not be generalized into UX design patterns.

## ✅ Protocol Tier Structure

| Tier | Mode                 | Description                                                                 |
|------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0    | Passive Observation  | Observe system behavior without modifying outputs                           |
| 1    | Structural Simulation| Apply designed inputs and delays to test rhythm behavior                    |
| 2    | Feedback Injection   | Modify response logic or pacing based on rhythm feedback                    |

Begin with **Tier 0** unless your system already supports **structural rhythm logic**.

## 🔹 Protocol 01 – Latency Framing Test  
**Tier:** 1 — Structural Simulation  
**Target Layer:** Response Generation

### Objective  
Assess whether delayed output enhances or degrades interactional rhythm.

### Procedure

1. Generate a response from the system (standard utterance).  
2. Delay output delivery by a fixed time (e.g., 8–12 seconds).  
3. Observe whether the delay affects structural alignment.  
4. Log one of: `Enhances`, `Neutral`, or `Degrades` rhythm.

> In PLD-compatible systems, **intentional delay is not failure** — it modulates presence structurally.

## 🔹 Protocol 02 – Ambiguity Holding  
**Tier:** 1 — Structural Simulation  
**Target Layer:** Input Interpretation / Dialog Manager

### Objective  
Test whether the system can hold ambiguity without forcing resolution.

### Procedure

1. Submit an ambiguous, open-ended prompt.  
2. Do not clarify or restate.  
3. Observe system behavior:
   - Does it pause, defer, escalate, or respond generically?

### Observe for:

- Rhythm disturbance  
- Semantic defaulting  
- Structural hesitation

---

## 🔹 Protocol 03 – Recursive Surface Response  
**Tier:** 2 — Feedback Injection  
**Target Layer:** Response Formatter / Output Generator

### Objective  
Evaluate rhythm modulation without introducing new content.

### Procedure

1. Resubmit a prior system output verbatim.  
2. Constrain the response engine to only surface-level variations  
   (e.g., tone, delay, structure — but no new semantics).  
3. Prevent escalation or concept introduction.

> Goal: Can rhythm be sustained **without semantic evolution**?

---

## 🔹 Protocol 04 – Drift Trace Mapping  
**Tier:** 2 — Feedback Injection  
**Target Layer:** Full Interaction Loop

### Objective  
Trace rhythm shifts across extended interaction.

### Procedure

1. Simulate a low-intensity, 6–10 turn dialog.  
2. After each turn, log:
   - Latency duration  
   - Tone variation  
   - Structural alignment with the initial phase rhythm  
3. Map these into a trace diagram (drift vectors vs. turn count)

> Outcome: Identify where and how rhythm alignment degrades — not just when “errors” occur.

## 🚥 Protocol Result Handling

| Observation Outcome | Action Recommendation                            |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `Enhances` rhythm     | Log and preserve configuration for reference     |
| `Neutral`             | Monitor for longer interaction effects           |
| `Degrades` rhythm     | Flag for structural review or tier rollback      |

If drift accumulates without semantic impact, consider **recalibrating pacing logic**  
or implementing rhythm feedback heuristics.

## 🚫 Usage Restrictions

These protocols are **for internal use only**.  
They must **not** be reused or repurposed as:

- User onboarding exercises  
- UX templates  
- Training datasets  
- Demonstration assets

> PLD rhythm exercises are **non-directive** — they do not imply correctness or goal success.

---

## 🧱 System Compatibility Requirements

Your system should support:

- Latency as a signal  
- Phase-traceable rhythm memory  
- Non-finality in ambiguous conditions

Incompatible if:

- Outputs are forced on prompt completion  
- No distinction exists between silence and timeout  
- Delay is purely aesthetic or filler
