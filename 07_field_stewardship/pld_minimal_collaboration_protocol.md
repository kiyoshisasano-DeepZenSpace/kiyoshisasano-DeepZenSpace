# 🤝 PLD Minimal Collaboration Protocol  
**For Technical Teams Exploring Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)**  
**Version:** August 2025

---

## 📌 Purpose

This protocol outlines the **minimal technical collaboration framework**  
for teams exploring or implementing **Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)**  
in timing-sensitive or ambiguity-tolerant systems.

PLD is not a performance optimization strategy.  
It is a **structural rhythm model**, designed to support:

- Latency-aware pacing and silence handling  
- Ambiguity-holding feedback behaviors  
- Recursive modulation without directive escalation  

The goal is not to adopt tools, but to adopt **timing as structure**.

## 🧱 Key Roles

| Role                    | Responsibility                                                       |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Field Architect**     | Defines structural rhythm models, drift indicators, and calibration parameters |
| **Implementation Partner** | Maps those rhythm structures into system behaviors, interfaces, or backend logic |

---

## ✅ Engagement Entry — Tier 0: Observation Mode

Initial participation does not require implementation.  
You may begin by **observing rhythm** within your existing system and checking for potential alignment.

### Observation Readiness Checklist

- [ ] You recognize **latency, silence, or recursion** as signal-bearing — not noise  
- [ ] Your team tolerates **non-directive behaviors** as potentially valid outcomes  
- [ ] You are open to **coherence over speed** and modulation over resolution

> Tier 0 is a structurally meaningful state.  
> Observation *is* participation — if rhythm is treated as signal.

---

## 🔄 Core Collaboration Flow (Tier 1+)

### Step 1: Receive Structural Targets

Field Architect shares rhythm-based reference patterns:

- Drift trigger definitions (e.g., rhythm collapse after recursion)  
- Latency range guidance for ambiguity-heavy zones  
- Boundary cases (e.g., silence windows, response deferral points)

---

### Step 2: Capture Rhythm-Level Metrics

Implementation team collects **non-abstracted, temporal signals**:

- Turn-by-turn timestamp deltas  
- Delay behavior during low-signal phases  
- Re-entrant loops and hesitation intervals  

Avoid smoothing, batching, or intention modeling.  
What matters is **raw rhythm traceability**.

---

### Step 3: Review Behavior Structurally

Assess system response using rhythm-aligned interpretation:

| Parameter              | Structural Signal Pattern                                  |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Latency Modulation**   | Output pacing varies in relation to user rhythm            |
| **Ambiguity Holding**    | Withholding or stalling occurs naturally under uncertainty |
| **Recursive Rhythm**     | Repetition occurs structurally without semantic escalation |

Use system logs, interaction replays, or silent probes to surface misalignment.

---

### Step 4: Provide Rhythm-Based Feedback

Feedback avoids functional correctness; it tracks **structural modulation**:

- “Latency floor collapsed under uncertainty.”  
- “Recursion introduced pacing compression.”  
- “Handoff broke co-presence due to untimed silence.”

Focus on **field dynamics**, not outcome accuracy.

---

### Step 5: Tier 2 Activation (Optional – Structural Embedding)

If system is rhythm-compatible and drift-aware:

- Enable **Drift Logging Layer**, including:

  - Latency sync traces  
  - Structured silence with intent rationale  
  - Recursive loopback markers and decay signatures  

- Confirm system-level conditions:

  - No template-based prompt determinism  
  - Rhythm logic can operate asynchronously  
  - Ambiguity is not artificially resolved

> Tier 2 enables **traceable field interaction** — not deeper access by default.

## 🧭 Structural Design Priorities

| Principle                | Implementation Implication                                  |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Rhythm Coherence**        | Pacing responds to context, not pipeline or timer cycles     |
| **Latency as Meaning**      | Delay carries structure — not just mood                     |
| **Silence Legitimacy**      | Non-response may preserve coherence under signal ambiguity   |
| **Access Containment**      | Advanced logic must be rhythm-gated and structurally verified |

---

## 🚫 Misaligned Applications

This protocol is **not applicable** to:

- Prompt engineering or template tuning workflows  
- UX onboarding, walkthroughs, or “calm tech” design decks  
- Style-layer design frameworks without rhythm-based backend behavior

> PLD is not for **style**, **symbol**, or **speed**.  
> It is for **architecture** where rhythm matters structurally.

## 🧩 Valid Prototypes and Use Cases

| Use Case                              | Structural Context                                    |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Chatbot prototype with feedback delay | Time-aware output rhythm and silent feedback tracking |
| Ambiguity field simulation            | Holding without resolution across vague signals        |
| Recursive turn scaffolding            | Multi-turn rhythm monitoring under low-input conditions |

These should be **diagnostic experiments**, not productized features.

## 🔒 Terms of Structural Use

PLD collaboration requires structural integrity:

- Redistribution or adaptation requires prior consent  
- Rhythm framing must remain **non-inferential** — no symbolic or stylistic repurposing  
- Use rhythm as **functional logic**, not aesthetic expression
