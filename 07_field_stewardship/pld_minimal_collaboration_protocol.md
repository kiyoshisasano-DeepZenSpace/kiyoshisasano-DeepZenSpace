# 🤝 PLD Minimal Collaboration Protocol  
**For Technical Teams Exploring Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)**  
**Version:** August 2025

---

## 📌 Purpose

This protocol defines the **minimal technical collaboration workflow** for teams exploring  
or implementing **Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)** in timing-sensitive or ambiguity-tolerant systems.

PLD is a structural model — not a performance enhancer.  
It is designed to support:

- Latency-aware interaction pacing  
- Ambiguity-preserving response logic  
- Rhythm-modulated behavior and withholding  

This document helps teams align structurally while avoiding premature coupling or misapplication.

## 🧱 Key Roles

| Role                  | Responsibility                                                   |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Field Architect**   | Defines structural pacing models and drift markers               |
| **Implementation Partner** | Applies rhythm logic to interface and backend systems             |

---

## ✅ Engagement Entry: Tier 0 (Observation Mode)

You may begin PLD-aligned collaboration by simply **observing structural rhythm** in your system.

### Checklist:

- [ ] You can interpret **latency, silence, and recursion** as signal-bearing  
- [ ] Your team accepts **non-directive behaviors** as valid outcomes  
- [ ] You're open to pacing logic that **is not tied to speed or resolution**

> Systems built purely for throughput or deterministic output pipelines are not suitable for PLD.

## 🔄 Core Collaboration Workflow (Tier 1+)

### Step 1: Receive Structural Targets

Field Architect shares definitions such as:

- Drift events (e.g., flattening after recursion)  
- Latency and pacing thresholds  
- Evaluation scenarios for ambiguity holding

---

### Step 2: Capture Rhythm-Sensitive Metrics

Implementation team collects:

- Timing deltas between turns  
- Delay behavior during ambiguity  
- Recursion indicators or hesitation windows

Use **raw, timestamped logs** — no smoothing, averaging, or abstraction.

---

### Step 3: Review Behavior Structurally

Analyze system interaction for:

| Parameter            | Expected Structural Signal                               |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Latency Modulation** | Output delay adapts to user pacing                        |
| **Ambiguity Holding**  | Unclear inputs may delay or defer resolution             |
| **Recursive Rhythm**   | Re-entry into prior state preserves pacing structure     |

---

### Step 4: Structural Feedback Loop

Feedback should reference rhythm states — not correctness:

- “Latency collapsed below ambiguity threshold”  
- “Second recursion caused rhythm compression”  
- “Response pace desynchronized from user input rhythm”

Adjustments focus on **modulation**, not goal completion.

---

### Step 5: Tier 2 Activation (Optional)

If enabling deeper structural embedding:

- Enable **Drift Logging Layer** to capture:

  - Latency synchronization events  
  - Silence windows with cause metadata  
  - Recursive rhythm shift points  

- Confirm:

  - No template-based prompt biasing  
  - Rhythm logic can operate asynchronously  
  - Ambiguity is not forcibly collapsed

> Tier 2 participation implies readiness for structural traceability and rhythm diagnostics.

## 🧭 Structural Design Priorities

| Design Principle         | Implementation Implication                                  |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Rhythm Coherence**        | Output pacing adapts to contextual flow                     |
| **Latency as Meaning**      | Delay is functional, not aesthetic                          |
| **Silence Legitimacy**      | Non-response may be intentional and necessary               |
| **Access Containment**      | Advanced logic is gated by verified structural alignment     |

---

## 🚫 Exclusions

This protocol is **not intended for**:

- Prompt design optimization workflows  
- General UX onboarding guides  
- Style-based design pattern frameworks

Apply it only within **PLD-compatible architectures** that treat timing and pacing structurally.

## 🔒 Terms of Use

This protocol is distributed under **alignment conditions**:

- Redistribution or adaptation requires approval  
- Application must preserve **non-inferential rhythm framing**  
- PLD integration must treat rhythm as a **functional design input**, not a stylistic layer
