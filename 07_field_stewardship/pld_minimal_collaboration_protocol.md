# 🤝 PLD Minimal Collaboration Protocol  
**For Technical Teams Implementing Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)**  
**Version:** August 2025

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This protocol outlines the **minimal technical collaboration process** for engineering teams working with systems that align with **Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)**.

PLD is **not a performance-optimized architecture**.  
It is a structural interaction framework based on:

- Latency-aware modulation  
- Ambiguity tolerance  
- Non-directive pacing logic  

This document ensures implementation teams operate with rhythm-consistent assumptions from the outset.

## 🧱 Role Definitions

| Role                  | Responsibility                                                   |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Field Architect**   | Defines rhythm logic, drift criteria, and structural pacing models |
| **Implementation Partner** | Translates rhythm structures into interface, backend, and signal logic |

---

## 🛂 Step 0: Compatibility Check

Before collaboration begins, the team must verify:

- Understanding of **non-directive interaction principles**  
- No hard dependency on immediate outputs or prompt determinism  
- Willingness to prioritize **rhythmic coherence** over speed or resolution

> ⚠️ Systems driven by performance benchmarking or fixed-response pipelines are incompatible with PLD.

---

## 🔄 Core Collaboration Workflow

### ✅ Step 1: Receive Structural Targets

The Field Architect provides:

- Drift event definitions (e.g., delayed response under semantic load)  
- Evaluation markers (e.g., latency ranges, recursion thresholds)  

**Example Targets:**

- Observe timing shifts during high ambiguity  
- Track phase retention in low-signal conversational loops

---

### ✅ Step 2: Capture Signal-Level Metrics

Capture logs without smoothing or abstraction:

- Input timing deltas  
- Token-level recursion patterns  
- Latency window variances  

Use timestamps to preserve raw interactional rhythm.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Behavior Review

Assess PLD-relevant dynamics:

| Parameter            | Expected Behavior                                          |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Temporal Modulation** | Adapts output pacing to user rhythms, not fixed cycles      |
| **Ambiguity Handling**  | Holds or withholds responses when signals are unclear      |
| **Recursion Control**   | Maintains rhythm without introducing semantic escalation   |

---

### ✅ Step 4: Structural Feedback Loop

Provide implementation feedback using structural language:

- “Latency collapsed below ambiguity threshold.”  
- “Third recursion caused drift flattening.”  
- “Pacing mismatch introduced semantic closure too early.”  

Adjust system behavior toward **modulation consistency**, not completion velocity.

---

### ✅ Step 5: Boundary Tiering (Optional)

If enabling advanced features (e.g., memory loops, silence gating):

- Confirm drift rhythm stability under load  
- Ensure **no prompt template inference** is active  
- Enable a **Drift Logging Layer** to capture:

  - Latency sync events  
  - Silence windows with rationale  
  - Recursion patterns and rhythm breakpoints

> Tier 2+ deployment must include structural logging for future traceability.

---

### ✅ Step 6: Resonance Checkpoints

At project milestones, perform rhythm-centric checks:

- Does latency modulation persist across semantic densities?  
- Are output delays synchronized with user pacing?  
- Is withholding behavior aligned with ambiguity events?

> Traditional success metrics (completion rate, response speed) are deprioritized.  
> **Resonance and rhythm coherence take precedence.**

## 📌 Core Design Principles

| Principle          | Implementation Guideline                                |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Rhythm Coherence**  | Output timing adapts to field dynamics, not clock cycles |
| **Latency as Signal** | Delay is structurally meaningful, not ornamental         |
| **Access Control**    | Advanced logic gated by rhythm validation                |
| **Silence Legitimacy**| Non-response may be structurally required               |

## 🚫 Usage Limitations

This protocol must **not** be repurposed as:

- General UX onboarding material  
- Prompt design schema  
- Productivity pattern reference

Use **only within PLD-aligned systems** with explicit structural framing.

## 🔒 Usage Terms

> This document is distributed under alignment conditions.  
> Redistribution, adaptation, or public abstraction is not permitted without approval.  
> PLD integration requires treating rhythm as a **functional system component**, not a **stylistic choice**.
