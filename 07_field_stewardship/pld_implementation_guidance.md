# 🛠️ PLD Implementation Guidance  
**Version:** August 2025

---

## 📌 Purpose

This document provides a structured reference for implementing **Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)**  
in prototype, research, or modular system environments.

PLD is **not an API, toolkit, or optimization layer**.  
It is a structural model for managing interaction rhythm — applicable only in systems where **timing**, **ambiguity**, and **latency** are treated as design-relevant signals.

---

## ✅ Freely Usable Resources

The following components are available under **CC BY-NC 4.0** for non-commercial, experimental use:

| Resource                | Description                                              |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `00_overview.md`        | Structural framing of rhythm and latency interaction     |
| `resonance_gate.py`     | Scaffold for conditional timing gate behavior            |
| `drift_scoring_v0.9.md` | Heuristic model for detecting interactional drift        |

### Conditions:

- Attribution required: _“Phase Loop Dynamics — Kiyoshi Sasano”_  
- Use must preserve **structural logic** and original framing  
- Redistribution must be non-commercial and context-preserving  

> For commercial use or redistribution, contact is required in advance.

---

## 🔒 Access-Controlled Modules

The following components are restricted due to architectural sensitivity:

- `PLD_License_v0.2.pdf` — Usage terms for licensed latency logic  
- Structural delay shells and rhythm calibration scaffolds  
- Experimental interface structures (e.g., civic latency models)  
- Rhythm attunement logic prototypes (non-public)

These involve architecture-specific trace logic. Misuse may cause **misaligned interaction behavior**.

---

## ✅ Valid Implementation Conditions

PLD requires the system to support:

| Condition                     | Description                                                    |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Trace-Aware Latency**        | The system can interpret silence, pause, or delay structurally |
| **Recursive Rhythm Feedback**  | Timing loops are not forced to converge or resolve             |
| **Ambiguity Preservation**     | Not all inputs must lead to final output or resolution         |
| **Output Decoupling**          | Input and output are rhythmically but not temporally linked    |

If your system enforces **immediacy**, **resolution**, or **continuous output**, PLD is not appropriate.

---

## ⚠️ Misuse Patterns to Avoid

Do **not** apply PLD if:

| Pattern                        | Description                                                   |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Aesthetic Delay**             | Latency is added for "minimalism" or to simulate depth        |
| **Implied Attentiveness**      | Silence mimics presence but has no structural logic           |
| **Response Withholding as Style** | Feedback is removed to imply calm or elegance               |

> These produce **surface-level artifacts**, not structural rhythm.  
> PLD does not simulate — it structures.

---

## 🧩 Examples of Valid Use Cases

PLD can be meaningfully applied in:

- **Chatbot feedback pacing** — interpreting delay as signal, not failure  
- **Dialogue recursion models** — holding state open across iterations  
- **Latency-sensitive decision logic** — allowing pause-based arbitration  
- **Reflective UI prototypes** — where non-response or delay is functional  

These are valid only if the **architecture supports rhythm as a state layer**, not as a cosmetic effect.

## ⚙️ Implementation Entry Patterns

You may introduce PLD in lightweight form using:

| Pattern                     | Description                                                         |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Timing Gates**             | Use conditional logic to gate outputs based on latency thresholds  |
| **Silence Classification**   | Track pause as a structural signal, not a failure state            |
| **Drift Heuristics**         | Log and surface misalignment across pacing and recursion layers    |

These allow safe PoC exploration **without full structural embedding**.

## 🤝 Collaboration Pathways

PLD-aligned experimentation is welcome in areas such as:

- SDKs for non-directive systems  
- UX modules tolerant of ambiguity and recursion  
- Human–AI systems using delay as a coordination signal  
- Multimodal interfaces where pacing affects interpretation

📩 Contact:  
**deepzenspace [at] gmail [dot] com**

Please include:

- Intended use case or domain  
- Scope of integration or experimentation  
- Any experience with rhythm-aware or latency-sensitive systems

Engagement is evaluated based on structural compatibility and design maturity.

## 🧭 Final Considerations

PLD is not a presentation layer. It is a **deep structural schema** for timing-sensitive interaction.  
Apply only when:

- Delay carries design intent  
- Resolution is not always required  
- Timing reflects internal state — not just external behavior

> PLD is not a delay engine.  
> It is a **modulation framework** for rhythm integrity.
