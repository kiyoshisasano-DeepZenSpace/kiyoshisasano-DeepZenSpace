# 🛠️ PLD Implementation Guidance  
**Version:** August 2025

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This document provides a practical reference for teams exploring or integrating **Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)** into technical or interface-level systems.

PLD is **not an API or prompt set**. It is a **structural interaction architecture**, designed to support:

- Latency-aware system pacing  
- Ambiguity-tolerant interaction loops  
- Rhythm-governed feedback and silence handling in human–AI or distributed systems

## ✅ Freely Usable Components (CC BY-NC 4.0)

The following resources are available for experimental, academic, or prototype use:

| Resource                | Description                                             |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `00_overview.md`        | Non-inferential structural framing for rhythm handling |
| `resonance_gate.py`     | Basic scaffold for timing gate logic                   |
| `drift_scoring_v0.9.md` | Heuristic logic for identifying interactional drift    |

### Usage Conditions

- Non-commercial use only  
- Attribution required:  
  _“Phase Loop Dynamics — Kiyoshi Sasano”_  
- Redistribution must preserve context and structure  

> ⚠️ For commercial deployment, integration, or redistribution, contact is required in advance.

## 🔒 Restricted Components (By Request Only)

The following PLD-aligned artifacts are access-controlled due to system sensitivity:

- `PLD_License_v0.2.pdf` – Licensing terms for structural rhythm logic  
- Latency shell modules and delay scaffolds  
- Experimental interface frames (e.g., civic latency field models)  
- Non-public rhythm attunement prototypes  

These involve non-reproducible trace states and may result in **interpretive misalignment** if used without rhythm-calibrated architectures.

---

## 🧱 PLD Structural Constraints

PLD includes intentionally **non-normative interaction patterns**, such as:

- Designed silence as structural signal  
- Feedback withholding as intentional trace  
- Decoupling of user input and system output rhythm  

To preserve coherence, PLD must be embedded in systems that support:

- Interactional pacing memory  
- Structural rhythm feedback loops  
- Field-aware latency calibration  

### ❗ Do NOT use PLD principles if:

- Delay is used purely for aesthetic effect  
- Silence is mimicking attentiveness without structural tracking  
- Latency is added to simulate depth without interactional alignment  

### 🚫 Misuse Examples:

- Passive delays presented as mindfulness  
- Disconnected latency framed as minimalism  
- Removing system feedback to imply elegance or calm  

Such cases lead to **structural incoherence**, and may produce adverse effects in UX or AI mediation.

## 🤝 Collaboration & Inquiry

PLD-aligned experimentation is welcome in areas such as:

- SDK scaffolds for non-directive systems  
- Interface designs that allow non-resolution  
- Timing-sensitive or rhythm-regulated interaction logic  
- Human–AI mediation where pacing reflects internal state

📩 Contact:  
**deepzenspace [at] gmail [dot] com**

Please include:

- Intended application or system domain  
- Timeline and scope of inquiry  
- Research goals or integration context  

Collaboration is considered based on structural compatibility and ethical alignment.

## 🧭 Closing Notes

PLD is not a surface feature —  
it is a **deep structural logic** that requires architectural commitment.

- Apply only where **trace-based latency** can be interpreted  
- Use within environments that support **non-immediacy**  
- Integrate only when systems can sustain **unresolved rhythmic forms**

> PLD is a rhythm framework — not a performance layer.  
> Misuse reduces rhythm to delay. Proper use sustains coherence through absence.
