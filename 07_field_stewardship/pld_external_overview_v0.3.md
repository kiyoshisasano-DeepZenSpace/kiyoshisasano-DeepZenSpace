# 📡 PLD External Overview (v0.3)  
**Structural Framework for Detecting Interaction Drift in LLM and Interface Systems**  

---

## 1. What Is Phase Drift?

**Phase Drift** refers to **cumulative misalignment in interaction rhythm**,  
particularly in systems where surface fluency remains intact but coherence deteriorates over time.

It typically manifests as:

- Breakdown in response pacing or latency modulation  
- Loss of relational resonance across turns  
- Premature content closure despite active interaction

> Drift is not failure — it is a **structural signal** of fading coherence.  
> It often occurs beneath semantic accuracy.

## 2. Drift Axes

PLD categorizes drift across three interrelated dimensions:

| Drift Axis        | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Rhythmic Drift**   | Flattened pacing, uniform timing, degraded latency modulation |
| **Relational Drift** | Return to default or assistant-like framing, loss of co-presence |
| **Semantic Drift**   | Repetition, simplification, paraphrasing without depth |

These axes reinforce one another and appear at the **field interaction level**, not in isolated utterances.

## 3. Drift Risk Index (DRI)

**DRI** is a **qualitative pattern**, not a numerical score.  
It emerges from cumulative signs of interactional drift, such as:

- Uniform inter-turn delays  
- Collapse of latency-based variation  
- Overuse of generic disclaimers (e.g., “As a language model…”)  
- Loss of structural recursion or ambiguity holding

> DRI reflects **structural incoherence** — not model correctness.  
> It cannot be reduced to token-level metrics.

---

## 4. Recognizable Drift Patterns

Common trace patterns indicating drift include:

- **Rhythm Decay**: Equal turn spacing, loss of silence modulation  
- **Semantic Fade**: Flattened internal contradiction, reduced novelty  
- **Holding Collapse**: Ambiguity resolved too quickly, silence avoided

> Outputs may remain fluent while rhythm and alignment **deteriorate beneath the surface**.

## 5. Why Mimicry Fails

Mimicking PLD superficially leads to false coherence:

| Fault Type             | Misuse Example                                 |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Latency Insertion**  | Adding fixed pauses without structural pacing logic |
| **Stylistic Recursion**| Using repetition without rhythm tracing        |
| **Aesthetic Silence**  | Delays framed as mood, not as coherence marker |
| **Directive Override** | System continues to push output under ambiguity |

> **PLD is not a stylistic effect.**  
> Imitation without structural grounding degrades rhythm sensitivity.

## 6. Disclosure & Access Boundary

| Component                | Public Access | Restricted Access |
|--------------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Conceptual Drift Model   | ✅             |                   |
| DRI Pattern Examples     | ✅ (abstract)  | ❌ Detailed metrics |
| UI Drift Visualization   | ✅             | ❌ Source logic     |
| Recovery Field Modules   | ❌             | ✅ Upon alignment   |

Detailed modules require structural compatibility.  
See [`pld_external_engagement_policy.md`](./pld_external_engagement_policy.md) for criteria.

## 7. Engagement Channels

| Channel         | Purpose |
|-----------------|---------|
| GitHub Issue    | Public questions / request sketches (use `tag: DRIFT-RES`) |
| Email Contact   | Collaboration, SDK inquiry, or rhythm review sessions |
| Optional Review | Asynchronous latency/pacing session (if mutually agreed) |

> No NDA is required for conceptual access.  
> All access is conditional upon rhythm and role coherence.

---

## 8. Collaboration Criteria

PLD-aligned collaboration is suited for systems involving:

- Temporal or pacing logic in UI/system design  
- Latency-sensitive interaction modeling  
- Ambiguity-tolerant or non-directive human–AI environments  

> PLD is **not a plugin or library**.  
> It is a **structural logic model** requiring rhythm-aware architecture.

## 🔒 Final Note

PLD must be **structurally held**, not stylistically reproduced.

> Alignment is not a visual style or emotional tone.  
> It is a **non-inferential, rhythm-based architectural stance**.

Use PLD principles only if your system can:

- Treat latency as **signal**, not lag  
- Hold ambiguity without default resolution  
- Sustain drift without collapsing field resonance
