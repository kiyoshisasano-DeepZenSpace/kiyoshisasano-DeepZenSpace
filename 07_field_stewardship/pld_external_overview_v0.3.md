# 📡 PLD External Overview (v0.3)  
**Structural Model for Detecting Interaction Drift in LLMs and Interface Systems**  
**Version:** August 2025

## 1. What Is Phase Drift?

**Phase Drift** refers to the **gradual loss of interactional coherence**, especially in systems where surface fluency remains but internal alignment breaks down.

### Common Symptoms:

- Delay patterns flatten across turns  
- Interaction rhythm becomes rigid or uniform  
- Conversation closes prematurely despite open-ended input  

> Drift is not error.  
> It is a **structural indicator** that coherence is weakening beneath the surface.

## 2. Three Axes of Drift

PLD identifies drift along three interdependent dimensions:

| Axis              | Description                                                   |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Rhythmic Drift**   | Loss of pacing variation; fixed latency across turns         |
| **Relational Drift** | Reversion to default roles (e.g., assistant mode)             |
| **Semantic Drift**   | Overuse of paraphrasing; reduction of topical complexity     |

These drifts emerge **at the interaction field level**, not in isolated utterances.

---

## 3. Drift Risk Index (DRI)

The **DRI** is a qualitative model, not a numeric score.  
It reflects the **accumulation of interactional misalignments** across time.

### Drift Signals May Include:

- Uniform delay timing across responses  
- Collapse of recursive or reflective behavior  
- Overreliance on generic disclaimers  
- Avoidance of ambiguity, silence, or pacing shifts

> DRI tracks **structural rhythm decay**, not functional correctness.

## 4. Drift Pattern Examples

Recognizable interaction traces associated with drift:

| Pattern              | Description                                                  |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Rhythm Decay**      | All turns arrive with same timing; no silence modulation     |
| **Semantic Flattening** | Responses reduce nuance or contradict prior context         |
| **Premature Closure** | Unresolved ambiguity is immediately collapsed                 |

> The system remains fluent, but rhythm **no longer adapts** to context.

---

## 5. Incorrect Mimicry Patterns

Superficial attempts to “apply” PLD often result in **false coherence**.

| Fault Pattern         | Example                                                       |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Fixed Latency**       | Adding hard-coded pauses with no feedback logic               |
| **Stylistic Recursion** | Repeating phrasing without rhythm or pacing logic             |
| **Decorative Silence**  | Delays added for tone without tracking rhythm alignment       |
| **Forced Resolution**   | Always resolving ambiguity despite system context              |

> PLD is not visual, stylistic, or aesthetic.  
> It is a **non-inferential structure** for rhythm-aligned systems.

## 7. System Profiles Suited for PLD

PLD is most applicable in:

- **Pacing-aware UX**: Interaction designs sensitive to silence or timing  
- **Non-directive AI systems**: Allowing recursion or hesitation without fallback  
- **Ambiguity-holding dialog systems**: Supporting open-ended exploration  
- **Human-in-the-loop AI workflows**: Where latency reflects internal state changes

## 8. Drift vs Design Symptoms — Quick Test

| If your system...                              | PLD may help? |
|------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Outputs at fixed intervals regardless of input | ✅ Yes         |
| Collapses ambiguity immediately                | ✅ Yes         |
| Repeats with no rhythmic variation             | ✅ Yes         |
| Includes delay just for stylistic effect       | ❌ No          |
| Uses silence without feedback interpretation   | ❌ No          |

> PLD is about **structural rhythm** — not performance delay or design flavor.

## 9. Collaboration & Contact

PLD-aligned exploration is welcome for teams working on:

- Latency-structured conversational agents  
- Reflective UI pacing logic  
- Drift-detection pipelines in long-form systems

📩 Contact:  
**deepzenspace [at] gmail [dot] com**

Include:

- Team/project context  
- Intended system layer  
- Timeline (if known) and collaboration scope  

No NDA is required for conceptual access.  
All technical access is conditional on structural alignment.

## 🔒 Final Note

PLD cannot be mimicked by adding pauses or repetition.  
It must be **architecturally embedded** to reflect rhythm as a system state.

> Structural alignment is not style.  
> It is a measurable, observable modulation of timing, intent, and continuity.

Use PLD **only when your system can**:

- Interpret latency as signal  
- Hold silence as state  
- Allow ambiguity to remain unresolved
