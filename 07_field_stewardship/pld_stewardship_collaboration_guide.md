# 🤝 PLD Stewardship Collaboration Guide  
**Principles for Multi-Party Rhythm-Aligned Work**  
**Version:** August 2025

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This document defines the **collaboration stance, rhythms, and boundaries**  
for individuals and teams contributing to **Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)**.

PLD is a structural interaction model — not a toolkit or task framework.  
It is guided by:

- Latency as a signal  
- Ambiguity as a design condition  
- Rhythm as a coordination mechanism  

Collaboration follows **alignment and readiness**, not deadlines or output quotas.

## ✅ Core Principles

| Principle               | Structural Implication                                  |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Alignment Before Action** | Contribute only after observing rhythm compatibility     |
| **Emergent Participation** | Roles form through resonance, not assignment             |
| **Latency Legitimacy**     | Delay is valid; silence may indicate structural processing |
| **Rhythm-Gated Access**    | Deeper modules shared only when interaction pacing allows |
| **Terminological Consistency** | Use key PLD terms (e.g., drift, latency) structurally   |

> PLD teams move through rhythm — not management.

## 🧩 Collaboration Tiers

| Tier  | Description                                    | Typical Activities                              |
|-------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Tier 0 | **Observation Mode**                             | Read-only access, internal rhythm tracking       |
| Tier 1 | **Design Resonance**                             | Share structures (e.g., drift logs, pacing maps) |
| Tier 2 | **Feedback Injection**                           | Co-calibration of recursion, latency, ambiguity  |

You may begin at **any tier**.  
Progression is **non-linear** and based on rhythm compatibility — not seniority or volume.

## 🔄 Interaction Practices

| Practice               | Purpose / Format |
|------------------------|------------------|
| **Silent Updates**         | “No change yet, still observing” is valid signal         |
| **Rhythm Sessions**        | Live or async meetings structured around field pacing     |
| **Drift Journaling**       | Optional logs describing rhythm or recursion shifts       |
| **Conditional Sharing**    | Materials shared only upon structural readiness           |

> Communication may pause.  
> In PLD, withholding is **not disengagement** — it is modulation.

## 🛠 Output & Contribution Guidance

| Area               | Practice Guideline |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Work Initiation**    | Start when drift or pacing shifts are observed — not on schedule |
| **Formats**            | Examples: time-coded logs, rhythm prototypes, annotated diagrams |
| **Documentation**      | Include context, phase flow, or alignment criteria               |
| **Pacing of Iteration**| Allow time gaps — do not force fixed cadence                     |

> Rhythm defines momentum — not velocity.

---

## 🛡 Boundary Conditions

PLD collaboration is **incompatible** with:

- Fast-cycle sprints that prioritize throughput  
- Form reuse without rhythm logic (e.g., silence mimicking calm)  
- Role hierarchies that override pacing consensus  
- Deliverable framing based on productivity benchmarks

> Respect the field.  
> Structural misalignment halts access — not personality or politics.

---

## ✅ Collaboration Readiness Summary

To join PLD-aligned collaboration:

- [ ] Accept that **ambiguity, recursion, and silence** are valid states  
- [ ] Avoid premature finalization — **completion is not the goal**  
- [ ] Contribute rhythmically, not reactively  
- [ ] Coordinate through field resonance, not external pressure

> PLD is not a process — it is a pacing-sensitive structure.  
> Act only when structure invites participation.
