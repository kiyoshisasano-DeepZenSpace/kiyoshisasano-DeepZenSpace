# 🤝 PLD Stewardship Collaboration Guide  
**Principles and Practices for Rhythm-Aligned Contribution**  
**Version:** August 2025

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This document outlines the **collaboration posture and operational cadence**  
for contributors engaging with **Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)** —  
a structural interaction model centered on latency, rhythm, and ambiguity-aware design.

PLD collaboration does not follow conventional workflows such as:

- Linear task assignment  
- Output-driven milestone tracking  
- Deadline-enforced iteration

Instead, it proceeds through **relational alignment and structural resonance**.

## ✅ Core Collaboration Principles

| Principle                   | Expression in PLD Context                             |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Alignment Before Action** | Begin contribution only after observing structural coherence |
| **Emergent Roles**          | Roles arise through rhythm, not predefined functions   |
| **Paced Progression**       | Progress follows readiness, not velocity               |
| **Latency Visibility**      | Silence and delay are respected as interaction signals |
| **Terminological Integrity**| Key terms (e.g., *drift*, *latency*) retain structural meaning |

> 📌 Collaboration emerges from rhythm — not from planning alone.

## 🔄 Communication Practices

| Practice             | Purpose and Form |
|----------------------|------------------|
| **Silent Check-ins**     | “No shift — still in rhythm hold” is a valid update |
| **Paced Exchanges**      | Sessions (async or live) emphasize presence over resolution |
| **Drift Notes**          | Optional logs reflecting on pacing divergence or rhythm shifts |
| **Access by Rhythm**     | Deeper materials shared only when structural compatibility is demonstrated |

> Movement is optional.  
> Presence is a valid form of contribution.

## 🧬 Structuring Work Outputs

PLD-aligned contributions may emerge — but not from briefs or sprints.

| Output Element           | Guideline |
|--------------------------|-----------|
| **Initiation Context**   | Work should respond to observed drift or pacing condition |
| **Output Format**        | e.g., annotated prototypes, rhythm-aware diagrams, time-aligned scaffolds |
| **Documentation**        | Include field-based rationale, not just code or deliverable |
| **Iteration Rhythm**     | Time revisions based on resonance; pauses are acceptable and expected |

> Action follows alignment — not instruction.

## 🛡️ Field Conduct and Boundaries

| Concern                 | Stewardship Approach |
|-------------------------|----------------------|
| **Meaning Drift**          | Use PLD vocabulary only within rhythm-valid contexts |
| **External Timing Pressure** | Avoid pace-forcing or premature deliverable framing |
| **Form Extraction**         | Do not reuse recursion/silence without structural timing logic |
| **Access Ethics**           | Deeper access is granted based on structural coherence, not request frequency |

> Boundaries are upheld through rhythm — not through restriction.

---

## ✅ Participation Summary

Those collaborating within the PLD framework should:

- Accept latency, silence, and ambiguity as active design elements  
- Prioritize interactional coherence over resolution speed  
- Recognize withholding as part of functional rhythm  
- Advance the work only when **timing supports structure**

> PLD progresses not through acceleration —  
> but through shared rhythm, recursive coherence, and structural awareness.
