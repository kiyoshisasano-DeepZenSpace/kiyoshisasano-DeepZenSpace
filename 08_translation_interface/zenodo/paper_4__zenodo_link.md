## ðŸ§© Abstract

This paper introduces a revised model of structural layering grounded in rhythmic field dynamics.  
The Rhythmic 4-Layer Field Model departs from traditional hierarchical logic, proposing a four-zone system of symbolic density, flow variance, lateral reflection, and permeable holding.  
Each layer functions as a spatial-temporal field rather than a fixed level, emphasizing recurrence, resonance, and coherence over ascension.

This model provides a foundational structure for understanding syntax as a responsive field, applicable to generative systems and language-based AI.  
It forms the theoretical core of the Syntax Topology Project and underpins experiments in Translation Interface and structural drift mapping.
