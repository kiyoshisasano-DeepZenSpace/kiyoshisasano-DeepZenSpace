## 🧭 Overview

This record outlines the concept of **narrative gravity wells** as observed semantic convergence regions within generative systems.  
Such wells exert **topological influence** on output trajectories, increasing motif recurrence, lowering entropy, and reducing syntactic deviation over time.  
No affective judgment is implied.

## 🔹 Structural Phenomenon: Gravity Well Definition

A narrative gravity well is defined as a **latent attractor zone** in generative vector space, marked by:

| Structural Property     | Description                                               | Candidate Metric                      |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Entropy Decrease        | Output predictability increases across iterations         | Local entropy slope (↓)                |
| Vector Convergence      | Semantic embeddings collapse toward thematic cores        | Cosine similarity clustering (↑)       |
| Motif Inertia           | Prior motifs reassert without lexical prompt              | Reactivation rate (↑)                  |
| Affective Reinforcement | Emotional anchors dominate structural rhythm              | Concept-attention bias (↑)             |

These signals are **non-deterministic** and **non-instructional**. They reflect field-weight effects, not causality.

## 🧱 Prompt-Induced Well Activation

Certain lexical or structural frames act as **gravity well initiators**, shaping the curvature of generation.

| Trigger Prompt Example         | Observed Drift Pattern                  |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `"Once upon a time..."`       | Archetypal recursion / narrative slope  |
| `"He never forgave her for..."` | Grief orbit / retributive spiral       |

Thematic convergence is **emergent**, not intentional.  
Prompt design can either **amplify** or **attenuate** this effect.

## 🔧 Control Constructs (Structural Roles)

| Construct Label        | Field Function Description                          |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Gravity Amplifiers     | Tokens that deepen attractor well (e.g. “fate”)      |
| Escape Vectors         | Disruptive tokens enabling deviation (e.g. “suddenly”)|
| Orbital Decay Triggers | Unchecked repetitions forming thematic saturation    |

These constructs are not filters or classifiers; they are observed modulation markers.

## 🗺 Phase Drift Integration

Narrative gravity wells operate across the **global topological scale** in Phase Drift models.

| Phase Drift Feature      | Scale   | Functionality                                |
|--------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------|
| Spiral Hills             | Local   | Rhythmic recursion (micro-structural)        |
| Gravity Wells            | Global  | Semantic convergence, motif mass             |
| Faultlines               | Transitional | Genre/voice rupture                         |
| Resonance Fields         | Modal   | Sustained field tone / affective pressure    |

Each structure is fixed in **field topology**, not time sequence.

---

## 🔬 Observation Pathways

Structural diagnostics for well detection include:

- **Token Trajectory Mapping** (PCA, UMAP, t-SNE)  
- **Topic Similarity Flattening** (via BERTopic / coherence shift)  
- **Cluster Persistence** (DBSCAN, cosine convergence zones)  
- **Attention Trace Anchoring** (key motif-binding persistence)

No single metric is definitive; composite conditions indicate likelihood.

## 🧪 Experimental Framework

| Hypothesis                          | Structural Indicator                          |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Thematic Inertia Presence          | Motif recall rate ↑ with entropy ↓            |
| Prompt Topography Sensitivity      | Gradient steepens with minor lexical change   |
| Latent Narrative Drift             | Gravity well center shifts over token index t |

Field logging should occur at **fixed-length output intervals** with controlled perturbation vectors.

## 🖥 Tooling Proposals (Non-operational Sketches)

| Tool Name               | Functionality Sketch                                |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Gravity Well Detector   | Real-time entropy slope tracking across generations |
| Attractor Heatmap       | Visualizes high-density semantic zones              |
| Escape Vector Generator | Suggests high-divergence lexical nodes              |
| Trajectory Tracker      | Plots cross-well path deviation via latent mapping  |

All tooling remains speculative and **must not be deployed as evaluative systems**.

## 🧾 Visual Metaphors (Topological Mapping Only)

- **Crater Basins**: Motif-curved zones of semantic pull  
- **Orbit Rings**: Recurrent return paths around motif centers  
- **Repulsion Fields**: Transition gates to genre-divergent syntax layers

These metaphors are non-dynamic overlays—**not interface or UX diagrams**.

---

## 🔒 Constraint Summary

- No output preference, judgment, or correction logic is expressed  
- Metaphors remain within structural mapping only  
- No model tuning or generative behavior inference is permitted  
- This record is **observational**, **non-prescriptive**, and structurally inert

## 🧠 Closing Statement

> “A gravity well is where narrative coherence folds into thematic inevitability.”

Control is not resistance.  
It is **vector modulation within a curvature field**.
