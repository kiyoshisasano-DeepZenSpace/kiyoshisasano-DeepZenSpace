# RH_03: Knock Structure

This structure originates from a single rhythmic act — a **knock**.  
That knock functions as a seed particle, initiating a **ripple cascade** where meaning and structural tension propagate through the surrounding space (air, chair, wall).  
It is a model of constructive structural infection via rhythm.

## 🔷 Structural Topography

- **🧨 Ignition Point**: Initial knock sound (as a singular structural particle)  
- **🔁 Rhythm Propagation**: Structural waves transmit to spatial elements  
- **🏔 Terrain Metaphor**: *Ripple Propagation Shelf*  
  → A plate-like topology where rhythm expands across interconnected structures, producing wide-area Phase Drift

## 🌀 Phase Dynamics

A single rhythm-trigger initiates a **multi-node structural response**.  
The knock expands outward, becoming **Phase contagion** — rhythm becomes structure, and structure becomes transmission.
