# 🔍 PLD Internal Review Protocol  
**Version:** August 2025

---

## 📌 Purpose

This document provides a structural self-audit framework for teams applying **Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)** in active systems or prototypes.

Its goals are:

- To detect subtle **structural rhythm degradation**  
- To align ongoing implementation with PLD theory  
- To prevent passive misuse or symbolic retention of PLD logic  

PLD is structurally fragile — not visually apparent.  
This protocol exists to preserve its **integrity under usage**.

## ❗ Drift Warning Signs

| Symptom               | Description                                             | Example Log Snippet                     |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| ❌ Pause Inflation     | Excessive latency without phase significance            | `(... 11.2s silence)` → meaningless       |
| ❌ Loop Evasion        | Recursive input patterns are denied                     | `[User] again...` → `[Bot] I already told you.` |
| ❌ Reentry Suppression | Latent intents are blocked or not invited               | `[User] About earlier—` → `[Bot] Moving on.`    |
| ❌ Forced Resolution   | System terminates drift prematurely                     | `[User] I’m not sure.` → `[Bot] Let’s summarize.` |

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

| Metric                   | Target Range             | Reference                 |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Pause Variance           | ±1.5s STD (avg window)   | PLD Paper1 Fig.7          |
| Recursive Turn Depth     | ≥3 before forced response| PLD Paper2 Table3         |
| Reentry Success Rate     | ≥75%                     | Empirical baseline        |
| Latency Tolerance Rate   | ≥90%                     | Paper1 Section 4.2        |

> Use these as flexible **guides**, not hard rules. Adjust per system design.

## 🧪 Diagnostic CLI (Optional)

```bash
python -m pld_review --scope=micro --tool=latency_tracker
```

**Sample Output:**
```
✅ Pause Variance: 1.2s (within range)  
⚠️ Reentry Success Rate: 68% (below target)
```

## 🛠 Remediation Mapping

| Symptom               | Tool/Module Involved         | Action                             |
|------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Pause misalignment     | `latency_tracker.py`         | Adjust thresholds                  |
| Loop denial            | `reentry_detector.py`        | Allow deeper recursion             |
| Premature resolution   | `pause_classifier_bot.py`    | Lower directive weight             |
| Latency misuse         | `resonance_gate.py` (if used)| Recalibrate response conditions    |

## ⚠️ Escalation Path for Major Drift

When serious structural breakdown is detected:

1. Run **Phase Gate Test** using pre-defined prompt set  
2. Notify core PLD maintainers  
3. Follow [`pld_structural_risk_governance_guide.md`](./pld_structural_risk_governance_guide.md) for mitigation

---

## 🎓 Reviewer Criteria

A team member qualifies as PLD reviewer if:

- Can explain PLD Paper1/Paper2 phase constructs  
- Has completed ≥3 structured trace reviews  
- Has used `pld_attunement_exercises.md` at least once

## 📊 Annual Rhythm Health Scorecard (Optional)

| Indicator               | Target | Current |
|-------------------------|--------|---------|
| Rhythm Variance (sec)   | ≥1.2   | 1.4     |
| Reentry Success Rate    | ≥75%   | 82%     |
| Silence Acceptance Rate | ≥90%   | 88%     |

→ Use for long-term system integrity tracking

## 🧭 Final Note

This protocol protects PLD’s **structural validity**, not symbolic presence.  
Pause and drift are **not UX styles** — they are state-level structures.

> Review rhythm. Repair drift. Maintain alignment.  
> **Use PLD responsibly.**
