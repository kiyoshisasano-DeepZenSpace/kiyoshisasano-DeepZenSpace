# 05_field_stewardship â€” Collaboration & Deployment Manual
**Version:** August 2025

---

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose
This folder provides **practical manuals** for safely and efficiently deploying PLD during joint projects.  
It is organized to let partners **start small (PoC)** and **expand to production** without reading unnecessary files.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Read This First â€” Minimal Start

If you are a **new partner** starting a Proof-of-Concept (PoC),  
you only need the following **3 files**:

1. [`pld_onboarding_and_diagnostics.md`](./pld_onboarding_and_diagnostics.md)  
   â†’ Pre-deployment checklist & environment readiness  
2. [`pld_minimal_collaboration_protocol.md`](./pld_minimal_collaboration_protocol.md)  
   â†’ Step-by-step PoC setup  
3. [`pld_trace_examples.md`](./pld_trace_examples.md)  
   â†’ Example traces to verify event logging

## ðŸ“‹ Folder Structure

### **Step 1 â€” PoC Essentials (read first)**
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `pld_onboarding_and_diagnostics.md` | Confirm system readiness before integration |
| `pld_minimal_collaboration_protocol.md` | Minimal PoC setup steps |
| `pld_trace_examples.md` | Annotated examples for event verification |

---

### **Step 2 â€” Production Expansion**
*(Use after PoC validation)*

|------|---------|
| `pld_latency_calibration_protocols.md` | Fine-tune latency handling for your UX context |
| `pld_structural_risk_governance_guide.md` | Safeguards for timing-based systems |
| `pld_internal_review_protocol.md` | Ongoing self-audit process |

---

### **Step 3 â€” Collaboration Terms**
*(Read once during agreement stage)*  
All collaboration conditions and responsibility boundaries are combined here:
- `pld_collaboration_terms.md` *(merged from: `pld_external_engagement_policy.md`, `pld_field_stewardship_charter.md`, `pld_structural_scope_and_conditions.md`)*
