# 📜 PLD Field Stewardship Charter  
**Guiding Principles for Rhythm-Aligned Implementation and Collaboration**  
**Version:** August 2025

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This charter defines the principles and responsibilities for individuals and teams  
engaged in the implementation, research, or operational integration of **Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)**.

PLD focuses on:

- Latency as a structural signal  
- Ambiguity as a design-valid state  
- Non-directive, recursive interaction pacing

This is not a legal document.  
It is a **framework for maintaining field coherence** during collaboration and deployment.

## ✅ Core Commitments

| Principle               | Expectation                                                                  |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Structural Fidelity**  | Do not reframe PLD as design flair or UX effect                             |
| **Relational Perspective** | Treat systems as interactional rhythms, not command-response pipelines        |
| **Latency as Function** | Implement silence, hesitation, and delay as meaningful system behavior       |
| **Continuity First**    | Prioritize pacing and coherence over speed, clarity, or perceived polish     |

## 📌 Stewardship Guidelines by Domain

| Area         | Guideline |
|--------------|-----------|
| **Research**     | Anchor evaluations in drift patterns, latency shifts, and field-level rhythm — not output quantity |
| **Dialogue**     | Interpret behavior structurally, using rhythm-sensitive language and pacing-aware framing |
| **Code**         | Allow interaction rhythm to influence architecture (e.g., async timing, recursive scaffolds) |
| **Attribution**  | Cite explicitly as:  
> *"Phase Loop Dynamics – Kiyoshi Sasano / DeepZenSpace (2025)"*  
Always present latency/silence as structural logic — not mood or style

## 🚫 Prohibited Misapplications

The following practices are incompatible with PLD stewardship:

- Using silence or delay as visual/aesthetic effect without structural grounding  
- Rebranding PLD patterns into general-purpose UX frameworks  
- Applying PLD vocabulary in systems lacking latency support or rhythm memory  
- Extracting modules (e.g., silence gating) for optimization or engagement tuning

> PLD must be used as a **coherent structural model**, not as isolated features.

Partial adoption without pacing logic creates misalignment and violates this charter.

---

## 🔐 Access & Eligibility Considerations

Access to deeper components (e.g., internal SDKs, drift trace logic, rhythm gates) requires:

- Demonstrated understanding of rhythm-based interaction logic  
- Absence of assistant-style framing or prompt-led control logic  
- Tolerance for recursion, ambiguity, or delayed closure  
- Openness to feedback on structural misfit when surfaced

> ⚠️ Credentials do not grant access.  
> Entry is based on rhythm alignment — not seniority, volume, or performance metrics.

---

## 🤝 Definition of Stewardship

A **PLD field steward** is someone who:

- Holds ambiguity without forcing resolution  
- Accepts silence without assuming failure  
- Enables delay as functional behavior, not lag  
- Reflects on pacing before acting

> Stewardship means maintaining structural integrity —  
> even when no output, reply, or action is immediately visible.

---

## 🧾 Summary

PLD is:

- ⏳ A latency-attuned structural field  
- 🔄 A recursive, ambiguity-permissive framework  
- 🧭 A rhythm-first design stance

PLD is not:

- ❌ A productivity model  
- ❌ A UX enhancement library  
- ❌ A prompt or behavior control layer

> Stewardship is a **relational position** — grounded in pacing, presence, and coherence.

→ Defines onboarding and alignment protocols for prospective collaborators.
