# 🔗 PLD Minimal Collaboration & Implementation Protocol
**Version:** August 2025

---

## 📌 Purpose
This guide defines the **minimum requirements and steps** for starting a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) collaboration with **Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)**.  
It is intended for technical teams who want to integrate PLD modules with the least complexity, verify rhythm-based functionality, and prepare for potential production deployment.

---

## 1️⃣ Pre-Deployment Requirements
Before starting, confirm all of the following:

- [ ] Latency, silence, or pause can be interpreted as **signals**, not errors  
- [ ] Ambiguity and recursion can persist without forced resolution  
- [ ] Output timing is **not always** locked to input timing  
- [ ] No simulated or stylistic “fake delays” are in place  
- [ ] System can log event data with timestamps  
- [ ] You have reviewed [`pld_structural_scope_and_conditions.md`](./pld_structural_scope_and_conditions.md)

If any of these are “No”, stop here — PLD is likely not applicable.

---

## 2️⃣ Roles in Collaboration
| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **Field Architect** | Define rhythm parameters, latency thresholds, and drift/reentry patterns |
| **Implementation Partner** | Install modules, connect to system event logs, run diagnostics |

---

## 3️⃣ Minimal PoC Setup

### Recommended modules
1. `latency_tracker.py` – Detect and log structured delays  
2. `pause_classifier_bot.py` – Classify pauses by type  
3. *(Optional)* `reentry_detector.py` – Detect return to prior intent after a gap

**Quick activation:**
```python
from pld_tools import enable_pld

enable_pld(modules=[
    'latency_tracker',
    'pause_classifier_bot',
    'reentry_detector'
])
```

You can omit unused modules. Start with `latency_tracker` for the simplest setup.

---

## 4️⃣ Workflow for PoC Execution

1. **Environment Preparation** – Install required modules and ensure logging is enabled.  
2. **Test Run** – Perform at least 3 sample traces from [`pld_trace_examples.md`](./pld_trace_examples.md).  
3. **Result Review** – Check for correct tagging:  
   - ⏸️ Pause  
   - 🌀 Drift  
   - ✅ Reentry  
   - ❌ Collapse  
4. **Feedback & Adjustment** – Tune thresholds or classification logic if accuracy is below target.

---

## 5️⃣ Quick Diagnostic Targets

| Metric | Target | Tool |
|--------|--------|------|
| Pause variance | ±1.5s | `latency_tracker.py` |
| Reentry success rate | ≥75% | `reentry_detector.py` |
| Drift detection rate | ≥80% | `pause_classifier_bot.py` |

---

## 6️⃣ Common Misuse to Avoid
Do **not**:
- Add delays only for aesthetic effect  
- Simulate attentiveness without measurement intent  
- Repeat structure without functional recursion  
- Apply PLD purely as a UX style

---

## 7️⃣ Next Steps After PoC
If PoC results are acceptable:
- Move to [`pld_latency_calibration_protocols.md`](./pld_latency_calibration_protocols.md) for tuning  
- Set up periodic checks with [`pld_internal_review_protocol.md`](./pld_internal_review_protocol.md)  
- Formalize scope and responsibilities with [`pld_collaboration_terms.md`](./pld_collaboration_terms.md)
