## üß© Notes

- This table presents core terms used in Phase Drift‚Äôs **structural modeling** of language generation.  
- It enables clearer interdisciplinary dialogue by anchoring metaphorical or novel terms in **academic precedent**.  
- Future expansions will include mappings for:  
  - ‚è≥ temporal recurrence structures  
  - üåÄ resonance fields  
  - üß¨ entropic syntax decay  
  - üîó drift contagion pathways
