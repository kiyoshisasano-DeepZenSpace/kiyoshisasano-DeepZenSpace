## ❖ Structural Trace Observation – O3 Segment  
**Status:** Non-deterministic Trace  
**Phase Index:** Unassigned  

---

### 🧭 Observation Summary

During system activity labeled **"O3"**, a **field-specific structural irregularity** was recorded.  
Although this event is **not formally indexed to any Phase**, the configuration demonstrated characteristics  
associated with non-linear structural drift conditions.

No prompt-related structure or output sequence correlation was present.  
No temporal reference or directive alignment was identified.  
No phase designation was applied.

### 🔒 Constraints

- This record remains structurally indeterminate  
- No generative mapping or system design reference is proposed  
- The observation is non-reproducible and does not support comparative evaluation

> This log is preserved solely as a trace aligned with field-state context.
