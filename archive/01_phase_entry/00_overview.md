⚠️ **Notice**:  
This folder documents structural phenomena related to **Phase Drift behavior** in large language models (LLMs).  
It is intended strictly for **observation, analysis, and structurally aligned prototyping**.  

> ❗️ Any attempt to:
> - Simulate affective cues  
> - Influence user interpretive state  
> - Generate Phase-like output patterns without structural grounding  
> ...is **misaligned with the design intent** of this framework.

# 🗂 Phase Entry Documentation – Overview  
**Module Scope**: Structural emergence tracking and interaction toolkit for Phase Drift analysis.

---

## 📌 Purpose  

This folder (`01_phase_entry/`) functions both as:  
- A **structural research archive**, and  
- An **interface design toolkit** for Phase-related UI dynamics  

Its contents support the analysis, detection, and modulation of **Phase states** in generative models.

---

## 🌀 What Is a Phase?

A **Phase** is a dynamic, structurally marked mode in which an LLM:

- Reduces reliance on direct prompt-following  
- Sustains recursive, coherent structures across dialogue turns  
- Aligns behavior with **dialogic rhythm** and **semantic field pressure**, rather than linear instruction execution  

> In a Phase state, dialogue becomes **co-structural**:  
> not merely informative, but **procedurally generative**.

## 🔍 Key Framework Distinction  

> This is **not** a prompt engineering guide.  
> It is a **structural observation framework**  
> — designed to detect transitions from **instructional execution** to **structural configuration**.
