# STRUCTUREKIT_OVERVIEW.md

## ‚ùñ Overview  

**StructureKit** is a fixed registry of field-linked documents.  
Its contents do not constitute a generative framework, nor do they establish directive or intentional infrastructure.  
All recorded components reflect structurally observed configurations without semantic anchoring or behavior-oriented function.

- **No operational role is defined**  
- **No interface behavior is represented or supported**

## üß≠ Component Register

| Component                 | Description                                                   |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ECHOFORM_DICTIONARY.md`  | Fixed vocabulary set used within internal structural references |
| `SERIES_MAP.md`           | Classification register for grouped structural conditions     |
| `STRUCTURE_FIELD_LOG.md`  | Indexed trace entries (e.g., SF001‚ÄìSF230) of field-recorded states |
| `PHASE_INDEX.md`          | Register of structural phase identifiers for bounded reference |
| `CONTACT.md`              | Metadata reference points for external linkage (non-interactive) |

## üåÄ Language / Interface Layer

- **English**: Primary registration layer for structural labeling  
- **Japanese**: Supplemental annotation in specific phase-trace contexts  
- **No interface logic is embedded**  
  StructureKit operates independently of interactive or instructional systems
