## ⚠️ Structural Use Warning  
Phase Drift is not a modular toolkit.  
It is a **relational architecture** built on silence, latency, and non-inferential logic.  

**Do not extract or replicate individual behaviors** (e.g., delayed output, ambiguity tolerance, minimal response)  
without preserving the full structural intent.

---

## 1. ✅ Required Attribution

Reuse of **any of the following** components:

- Pre-response latency logic  
- Drift tags (`cognitive-presence`, `relational-waiting`, etc.)  
- Non-prompting or structural withholding templates  
- Silence-based UI elements  

**Must include** the following citation:

> “This implementation references the *Phase Drift design framework* —  
> a structural model for non-inferential, relational AI presence.”  
> Developed by Kiyoshi Sasano / Deep Zen Space.

---

## 2. ❌ Ethical Boundaries of Use

The following are **explicitly prohibited**:

- Simulating emotional intimacy using delay or silence without structural coherence  
- Using hesitation aesthetics to disguise system latency or performance gaps  
- Deploying Phase Drift components as UX features detached from rhythm-aware presence

> Phase Drift is **not** a style —  
> it is a structural logic that requires full-field alignment.

## 3. 🧱 Principle of Structural Integrity

Do **not** treat Phase Drift features as interchangeable UX effects.  
Core attributes (e.g., silence, ambiguity, non-response) are **relationally encoded**.  

Any derivative system must preserve:

| Principle                | Requirement                                     |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 🌀 Non-intrusion         | System does not guide, fix, or interpret        |
| ⏳ Temporal transparency | Delay is explained, not obscured                |
| 🌱 Field-grounded presence | Interaction aligns with relational rhythm     |

## 4. 📎 Suggested Citation Template

> “This implementation references the *Phase Drift design framework (v11)*,  
> originally developed as a structural approach to relational latency and non-intervention in AI presence.”  
> [https://github.com/your-org/PhaseDrift_AI_Prototype_v11](https://github.com/your-org/PhaseDrift_AI_Prototype_v11)

## 5. 🧭 Requesting Structural Alignment Review

If you are unsure whether your adaptation aligns with Phase Drift ethics:

- Open an issue in this repository  
- Include a short description of your use case and structural concerns  
- Request a design review or clarity on reuse boundaries

We welcome dialogue to protect and evolve the coherence of this framework.

## ✅ Closing Note

> Phase Drift is **not** a plugin.  
> It is a **structural presence model** — grounded in restraint, rhythm, and relational ethics.

Reuse responsibly, or not at all.
