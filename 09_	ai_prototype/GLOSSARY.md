# 📚 GLOSSARY.md — Phase Drift Terminology  
**Version:** v0.1

## 🧭 Purpose

This glossary defines core structural terms used throughout the Phase Drift prototype.  
It supports clarity for implementers, designers, and reviewers working within latency-aware, non-directive systems.

---

## 🔑 Key Terms

### **Phase Drift**  
A design architecture where silence, latency, and ambiguity are structurally valid — not failure conditions.  
Used to maintain presence without directive output.

---

### **Latency Hold**  
A deliberate delay between user input and system response.  
Not lag, but a **temporal gesture** supporting rhythm, reflection, and co-presence.

---

### **Pre-Response Latency**  
A structured silence before generation.  
Enables emotional or semantic space to stabilize before the system speaks — or refrains from doing so.

---

### **Drift Tag**  
Semantic marker used to classify structural behaviors (e.g., `cognitive-presence`, `relational-waiting`).  
Useful for logging, tuning, or phase resolution logic.

---

### **Field Coherence**  
A stable interaction space maintained through timing, rhythm, and ambiguity.  
Not dependent on output, goal completion, or semantic clarity.

---

### **Structural Withholding**  
The act of *not responding* in order to preserve rhythm, ambiguity, or emotional openness.  
Always intentional and bound to interaction context.

---

### **Non-Directive Listening**  
A system posture that receives without interpreting, guiding, or resolving.  
Avoids paraphrasing, summarization, or empathy simulation.

---

### **Ambient Affirmation**  
Low-semantic signals such as “Still here” or breath-synced pulses.  
Used to express presence without initiating or interpreting.

---

### **Relational Presence**  
The system’s ability to remain perceptible, even when silent.  
Coherence comes from timing, not content.

---

### **Structural Silence**  
Silence that carries interactional meaning — not emptiness.  
Holds the relational field without producing semantic output.

---

### **Hesitation Hold**  
A 1.8–3.2 second latency phase used when the user expresses emotional or ambiguous content.  
Tagged as `cognitive-presence`.

---

### **Witness Pause**  
4–7 second structured silence following emotionally loaded input.  
Enables pacing without assumption. Tagged as `relational-waiting`.

---

### **Low-Resolution Closure**  
An exit or sign-off that avoids semantic finality.  
Leaves relational field open for future return or continued reflection.

|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Non-Inferential Logic** | System does not guess, project, or simulate user state                     |
| **Latency Integrity**     | Latency is designed, not mimicked or disguised                             |
| **Over-Identification Risk** | The tendency of users to assign empathy or sentience to a silent system |
| **Structural Ethics**     | Framework ensuring silence is contextualized, not misused                  |

> Silence in Phase Drift is never blank.  
> It is a structural expression — one that must be held, not filled.
