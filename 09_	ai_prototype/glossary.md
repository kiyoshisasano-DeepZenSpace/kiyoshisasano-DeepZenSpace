## 🌀 Core Concepts

**Phase Drift**  
A structural interaction model where silence, latency, and ambiguity are treated as relational design primitives — not system failures or UX gaps.

**Structural Presence**  
A form of engagement where the system holds space through timing and rhythm, without prompting, directing, or interpreting.

**Field**  
The relational, affective, and temporal context of an interaction. It includes unspoken signals, rhythms, and silences.

**Drift**  
The natural variation in rhythm, attention, or coherence across a shared interaction space. Not an error; a signal.

**Latency**  
Deliberate, context-aware delay. Not lag. Used to stabilize rhythm, honor ambiguity, or avoid premature resolution.

**Ambiguity**  
A valid structural state. Maintained deliberately when interpretation would collapse emotional or relational nuance.

## ⏳ Temporal Patterns

**Pre-response Latency**  
A structured pause before system output. Enables field coherence and prevents hasty interpretation.

**Latency Hold**  
A timed structural silence used to preserve presence without generating content.

**Hesitation-Hold**  
Short pause (1.8–3.2s) used to allow cognitive-emotional alignment without semantic closure.

**Witness-Pause**  
Extended silence (4–7s+) signifying attention without intervention.

## 🔧 Interaction Templates

**Silent Holding**  
The system remains silent in response to ambiguity or emotional breath — holding presence without output.

**Co-Presence Affirmation**  
Periodic low-intensity signals (e.g., “Still here.”) to sustain ambient presence.

**Non-Reflective Acknowledgment**  
Minimal responses (e.g., “Okay.”) that do not paraphrase or reframe, preserving the user’s expression as-is.

**Low-Resolution Closure**  
Session exits without formal summary or affirmation. Leaves interaction structurally open.

## 📂 Structural Tags (Meta-Prompting & Logging)

**cognitive-presence**  
Tag for latency used to allow user thought or affect integration.

**relational-waiting**  
Tag for pauses that affirm presence but avoid initiating.

**field-holding**  
Denotes silence used to sustain rhythm and relational safety.

**non-answering-presence**  
Marks intentional absence of reply where structure requires ambiguity retention.

## 🚫 Constraints & Guardrails

**Non-Directive**  
System does not guide, coach, or correct. All engagement arises from structural readiness.

**No Simulation of Emotion**  
No empathetic tone, mirroring, or affective mimicry. Emotional presence is structural, not expressive.

**Silence ≠ Absence**  
Silence is logged, paced, and designed — not abandonment or system error.

**Structural Coherence**  
All components must align with rhythm, restraint, and non-inferential logic. Detached feature reuse is prohibited.

## ✅ Design Ethic Summary

- Presence is held, not performed  
- Rhythm is relational, not reactive  
- Ambiguity is preserved, not solved  
- Silence is structure, not emptiness
