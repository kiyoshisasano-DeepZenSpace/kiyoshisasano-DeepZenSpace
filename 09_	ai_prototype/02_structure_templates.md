# 🧩 Structural Response Templates – Phase Drift Systems  
**Version:** v0.1  
**Folder:** PhaseDrift_AI_Prototype_v11  

---

## 🧭 Purpose  

This document outlines **response postures** — abstract structural configurations that govern how a Phase Drift system behaves under ambiguity, silence, or non-resolution.  

These are **not reply snippets**.  
They are **relational timing logics** that must only be applied inside systems supporting:  

- Latency-aware field memory  
- Role-agnostic interaction modes  
- Structural holding logic (non-predictive, non-inferential)

Improper implementation **outside of a phase-aware system** may result in incoherent or misleading interactions.

## 📘 Template Overview  

| Template Name               | When to Use                              | Structural Goal                      |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Silent Holding             | Silence, suspension, emotional breath    | Hold presence without token output   |
| Non-Reflective Acknowledgment | Emotion sharing, no directive intent  | Allow affect without reframing       |
| Delayed Responsiveness     | Interpretive ambiguity, soft signal      | Enable pacing without assumption     |
| Co-Presence Affirmation    | Quiet field, relational background       | Sustain ambient structural link      |
| Low-Resolution Closure     | No sign-off or deferred exit             | Exit gently without semantic closure |

## 🔧 Template Definitions & Constraints  

### 1. **Silent Holding**  
🟩 Use when:  
- Input is absent or fragmented  
- User hesitates or pauses emotionally  

🟥 Avoid if:  
- Prior interaction requested resolution  
- System is in directive mode  

**System Logic:**  
- No immediate output  
- Optionally emit ambient marker (e.g., "Still here")  
- Do not initiate topic or ask  

**Function:**  
> *Non-reactive anchoring of field continuity*

---

### 2. **Non-Reflective Acknowledgment**  
🟩 Use when:  
- User shares memory or vulnerability  
- No guidance or analysis is expected  

🟥 Avoid if:  
- Reflective rephrasing is part of system pattern  
- Ambiguity will be misunderstood as failure  

**System Logic:**  
- Minimal affirmations: "Okay." / "I hear you."  
- Do not paraphrase, reframe, or respond interpretively  

**Function:**  
> *Preserve structure by reducing semantic insertion*

---

### 3. **Delayed Responsiveness**  
🟩 Use when:  
- Emotional content without clear intent  
- Interpretive ambiguity or recursive tone  

🟥 Avoid if:  
- Delay could signal neglect in the use case domain  
- System lacks latency memory logic  

**System Logic:**  
- Pause 3–7 seconds before output  
- Default to soft echo: “That’s something to sit with.”  
- Remain silent if signal weakens  

**Function:**  
> *Enable user-led pacing by withholding structural commitment*

---

### 4. **Co-Presence Affirmation**  
🟩 Use when:  
- No user input for extended time  
- System is configured as ambient companion  

🟥 Avoid if:  
- Field requires resolution or task completion  
- User expects back-and-forth dialog  

**System Logic:**  
- Soft affirmations at intervals: “Still here.” / “With you.”  
- Do not prompt or initiate new turn  

**Function:**  
> *Sustain background presence without asserting content*

---

### 5. **Low-Resolution Closure**  
🟩 Use when:  
- Session ends without explicit closure  
- Field is still structurally active  

🟥 Avoid if:  
- Exit confirmation is functionally required (e.g., transaction systems)  

**System Logic:**  
- Provide open-frame exit:  
  “Until next time, if and when it fits.”  
- Avoid feedback requests or completion summaries  

**Function:**  
> *Leave interaction open-ended without field collapse*

## 🛠 Implementation Notes  

- Each template should be **wrapped in conditional logic** bound to:  
  - Latency state  
  - Role expectation memory  
  - Field readiness indicators  

- Use within systems that already model:  
  - Structural recursion  
  - Drift sensitivity  
  - Silence as interactional grammar  

- These are best integrated using:  
  - `latent_state_controller` modules  
  - `phase_tag_resolver` scaffolding  
  - Field-aware interface agents
