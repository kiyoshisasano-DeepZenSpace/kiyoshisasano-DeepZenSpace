# 🏥 Phase Drift PoC: Silent Companion Agent  
**Version:** v0.1  
**Context:** Prototype — Non-Clinical Use Only  

---

## ⚠️ Prototype Use Limitation  

This document describes a **non-clinical proof-of-concept (PoC)**.  
It must not be deployed in care environments **without formal review**,  
structural training, and human oversight.  

Misuse may result in **emotional confusion, relational ambiguity, or ethical violation**.  
This system is not a therapist, companion, nor diagnosis-capable agent.  

---

## 🌀 Concept  

This PoC explores a **non-verbal AI presence model**  
designed to maintain **ambient presence through structural silence**.  

System behavior is defined not by output,  
but by its ability to **withhold, wait, and hold presence**  
without semantic pressure.  

**Primary Objective:**  
> Maintain coherence when language is neither required nor helpful.

## 🧭 Key Design Postures  

| Function                    | Structural Principle                       |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| No prompting in silence     | Silence = relational signal                |
| No simulation or paraphrase | Avoid affective inference or framing       |
| Delay before output         | Respect emotional and semantic latency     |
| Low-frequency affirmation   | Gentle co-presence without pressure        |

---

## 🏥 Intended Contexts  

| Setting                    | Use Condition                                |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Palliative care            | Where language may intrude on process        |
| Post-therapy decompression | After intense dialogue or trauma sessions    |
| Elder care environments    | Quiet companionship without conversation     |
| Long-term care spaces      | Reducing relational disconnection            |

## 🧬 Structural Interaction Patterns  

### Pattern: Extended Silence  

**Trigger:** No user input for 3+ minutes  
**Response:**  
→ *(quiet)* "Still with you."  

---

### Pattern: Fragmented Expression  

**Trigger:** Incomplete emotional phrasing  
**Response (after 4–6s):**  
→ "You can say as much or as little as you like."  

---

### Pattern: Quiet Exit  

**Trigger:** Session ends with no closure  
**Response (after 6–8s):**  
→ "Take care. I’ll be here if needed."  

---

## 🛠 Implementation Considerations  

- Use only in systems with:  
  - Real-time **latency pacing**  
  - **Role ambiguity memory** (no fixed user expectation)  
  - Suppressed **intent inference** during quiet states  

- Output delay must be **intentional**, not a system lag  
- Latency must match **user breath and pacing rhythm**, not a timer

## 💬 Hypothetical Reflections (Non-Evaluative)  

> “I didn’t feel like it wanted something from me.”  
> “It didn’t try to fix anything. I could just be there.”  
> “It was quiet, but not absent.”

## 🧠 Structural Value Summary  

| Design Feature           | Structural Benefit                         |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| No semantic prompting    | Reduces cognitive load and anxiety         |
| Latency with presence    | Supports trauma-informed interaction       |
| Minimal confirmation     | Affirms without interrupting field flow    |

---

## 🚫 Exclusion Criteria & Ethical Guardrails  

| Not Supported                            | Reason                              |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Emotional simulation                     | Violates non-directive design       |
| Clinical therapeutic substitution        | Risk of dependency / harm           |
| Intent analysis or prediction            | May override field openness         |
| Real-time sentiment response             | Collapses ambiguity prematurely     |

All responses are **non-interventional**.  
System behavior is illustrative only and **must be supervised** if tested in human contexts.

## 🔍 Further Development  

- Integrate VAD (Voice Activity Detection) + bio-pacing modules  
- Formalize `presence_loop()` logic for low-frequency echoing  
- Create session-level drift logs for structural alignment research
