## 🔖 Context

While this repository is shared under a standard **non-commercial license**,  
the **structural intent** of Phase Drift systems introduces additional obligations:

This framework involves **non-inferential logic**, **presence-oriented design**, and **latency as structure** —  
elements that cannot be ethically reused without preserving their relational coherence.

---

## 1. Structural Attribution (Required)

Any reuse of the following:

- Pre-response latency logic  
- Non-prompting UX behaviors  
- Drift tags (e.g., `cognitive-presence`, `relational-waiting`)  
- Structural withholding or silence-based templates

**must include explicit attribution**:

> _“This implementation references the Phase Drift design framework –  
> a structural model for non-inferential, relational AI presence.”_

This ensures traceability and prevents context-free aesthetic mimicry.

---

## 2. Ethical Boundaries of Use

These patterns **must not** be used for:

- Simulating emotional intimacy or “depth” artificially  
- UX delay tactics to mask system latency without relational logic  
- Attention retention through **aestheticized hesitation** divorced from structural purpose

> Phase Drift elements are not surface features.  
> They are **relationally encoded architectural choices**.

---

## 3. Principle of Structural Integrity

Phase Drift operates from a **coherence-first paradigm**.  
Its core elements (silence, ambiguity, latency) are **not modular effects**.

Any derivative must preserve:

- Non-intrusion and non-guidance ethics  
- Temporal transparency  
- Presence grounded in field response, not predictive function

---

## 4. Recommended Citation Template

> _“This implementation references the Phase Drift design framework (v11),  
> originally developed as a structural approach to relational latency and non-intervention in AI presence.”_  
> See: `https://github.com/[your-path]/PhaseDrift_AI_Prototype_v11`

---

## 5. Optional: Structural Review Request

If you're uncertain whether your adaptation aligns with Phase Drift ethics:

- Open an issue in this repository  
- Request a **review or clarification** of structural intent

> We welcome dialogue to preserve the fidelity of this framework.

---

## ✅ Final Note

This is not a style guide.  
It is a **structural protection layer** for non-inferential systems.

Thank you for honoring the **relational rhythm** and **ethical restraint** that Phase Drift requires.
