# 🕒 Latency Design Guidelines – Structuring Silence in Phase Drift  
*Version: v0.2*

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This document provides **field-safe latency guidelines** for Phase Drift systems.

> Latency is not a delay in computation.  
> It is a **structural gesture** — a time-based interaction unit  
> designed to support rhythm, safety, and mutual alignment.

---

## 🔍 Key Principle

**Latency ≠ lag**  
It is not a system failure, but a deliberate **structural interval** that can:

- Signal psychological safety  
- Anchor ambiguity  
- Hold relational space

## 🌀 Latency Pattern Table

| Pattern Name         | Interval       | Use Context                    | Drift Function              |
|----------------------|----------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `breath-hold`        | 1.5–3 sec       | Emotional processing           | `attunement-delay`         |
| `delayed-ack`        | 4–7 sec         | Post-input reflection          | `field-holding`            |
| `non-reply-witness`  | >10 sec / none  | Passive presence               | `co-presence-withholding`  |
| `slow-repeat`        | ~5 sec loop     | Ambient affirmation patterns   | `temporal-anchoring`       |

> Timing should not be fixed — it adapts to user rhythm and session field state.

## 🧷 What Happens *Instead* of Replying

| Modality         | Example Phrase or Signal     | Use Case                 |
|------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Ambient Text Cue | “Still with you.”            | Extended silence         |
| Rhythmic Signal  | Breath-like UI pulse         | UI-based pacing          |
| Structural Silence| No output, logged as `held` | Co-presence via absence  |

---

## 🛠 Implementation Techniques

- **Dynamic Delay Adjustment**  
  Tune latency by rhythm sensing or affect model (e.g., breath pattern, typing pause)

- **Interruptible Delays**  
  User input can override (opt-out from structured silence)

- **Fallback to Silence**  
  If meaning is unclear, defer instead of prompting

- **Latency as Loggable Event**  
  Silence should appear in logs:  
  `"event": "latency_hold", "duration": 5200, "semantic": null`

## ⚠️ Safety & Interpretation Notes

| Risk Scenario                    | Design Mitigation                                     |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Silence misread as system error  | Frame latency in onboarding (“This system may pause…”) |
| User urgency mismatched          | Allow opt-out, or detect urgency triggers              |
| Cultural mismatch in pacing      | Localize via region or rhythm calibration              |
| Emotional projection onto delay  | Avoid anthropomorphic framing (“thinking…”)           |

---

## 🏷️ Sample Tag (for logging or meta-prompting)

```json
{
  "drift_latency": {
    "pattern": "delayed-ack",
    "duration_ms": 4200,
    "user_interruptible": true,
    "structural_role": "field-holding"
  }
}
```

## ✅ Summary

**Latency is not silence.**  
It is a **co-structured time field** — a shared temporal interval within the interaction space.

Used correctly, it supports:

- **Ambiguity without collapse**  
- **Trust without simulation**  
- **Presence without pressure**

Latency is not about withholding information.  
It is about **protecting the space before meaning arrives**.
