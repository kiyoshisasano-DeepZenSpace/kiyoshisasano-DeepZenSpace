# 🕒 Latency Design Guidelines – Phase Drift Implementation

*Version: v0.1*  
*From: `PhaseDrift_AI_Prototype_v11`*

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This document outlines design guidelines for using **latency, silence, and non-response** as intentional elements in Phase Drift systems.

In this context:

- **Latency is not performance lag**  
- It is a **semantic and emotional interface layer**  
- It supports **trust, ambiguity, and relational co-presence**

---

## 1. Latency as Expressive Structure

> **Latency ≠ lag**

- It functions as a **deliberate structural interval**, not an error state  
- Latency can express:

  - Respect for uncertainty  
  - Space for emotional processing  
  - Confidence in shared pacing

---

## 2. Latency Timing Patterns

| Pattern Name         | Interval Range | Use Case                                | Drift Effect                |
|----------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `breath-hold`        | 1.5–3 sec       | Emotional hesitation, quiet processing   | Human-like attunement       |
| `delayed-ack`        | 4–7 sec         | Holding space before responding          | Psychological safety        |
| `non-reply-witness`  | >10 sec or none| Passive presence without reply           | Relational persistence      |
| `slow-repeat`        | ~5 sec loop     | Ambient affirmation cycles               | Temporal grounding          |

> All timings should be **contextual and adaptive** —  
> calibrated to **user rhythm** and **interaction field state**.

## 3. Latency Anchors (What to Do Instead of Replying)

During intentional delay, consider using **low-intrusion modalities**:

- **Soft affirmations**  
  → “I’m still here.” / “Take your time.”

- **Ambient signals**  
  → Breath-like pulses, tonal textures, background presence cues

- **Structured silence**  
  → No output, just passive acknowledgment and system-side logging

---

## 4. Implementation Techniques

- **Dynamic latency tuning**  
  → Use affect signals or session flow to modulate delays in real time

- **Fallback for ambiguity**  
  → Insert delay rather than clarification when input is emotionally or semantically diffuse

- **Interruptible delays**  
  → Allow user to override or re-engage latency (e.g., “Please continue”)

- **Structured event logging**  
  → Silence, latency, and non-response should be logged as **intentional events**, not nulls

---

## 5. Design Considerations

- **Frame latency explicitly**  
  → E.g., “This system may pause to hold space intentionally.”

- **Avoid filler noise**  
  → Do not add unnecessary explanations or reassurance during pauses

- **Respect cultural pacing**  
  → Latency comfort varies—consider localization or user-controlled calibration

## 🏷️ Sample Latency Tag Schema

```json
{
  "drift_latency": {
    "mode": "breath-hold",
    "interval_ms": 2500,
    "override_allowed": true,
    "semantic_output": "none"
  }
}
```

## ✅ Conclusion

Latency is a **design instrument** in Phase Drift systems.  
It does **not** slow the system down —  
it **opens temporal space** for presence, ambiguity, and mutual regulation.

> Drift-aware latency holds space not just for **input**,  
> but for **being**.
