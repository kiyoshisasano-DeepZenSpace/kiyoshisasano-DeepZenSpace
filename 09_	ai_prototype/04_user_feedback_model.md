# 🗣️ Simulated User Feedback – Phase Drift Structural Prototype

*Version: v0.1*  
*Context: Non-Empirical Design Simulation*  
*From: `PhaseDrift_AI_Prototype_v11`*

## ⚠️ Caution: Simulation Only

This document is a **design simulation artifact** —  
it is **not based on real users, testing, or field deployment**.

It must not be used for:

- Product validation  
- Marketing communication  
- Psychological inference  

Its sole purpose is to guide **interface sensitivity tuning**  
within Phase Drift architectural boundaries.

---

## 🧭 Why This Matters

When building **non-directive, latency-based systems**,  
typical UX expectations break down.  
This file provides structural hypotheses for how users might  
react to silence, ambiguity, and absence of directive closure.

## 👤 Simulated User Profiles

### 1. 🪞 Reflective Presence Seeker

- Welcomes delay and withholding  
- Interprets non-response as “permission”  
- Says: *“It felt like it gave me space.”*

### 2. 🌫️ Hesitant or Tentative

- Begins unsure: silence feels unfamiliar  
- Tests interaction with cautious speech  
- May later reflect: *“I didn’t feel judged.”*

### 3. 🔧 Task-Oriented User

- Expects instruction-following  
- Reads silence as malfunction  
- May need preface such as:  
  *“This system may pause — that’s by design.”*

## 🧪 Illustrative Feedback Snippets

> Not transcripts — imagined field echoes.

- “I thought it was broken. Then I noticed it was just… still.”  
- “It didn’t ask me to explain. I liked that.”  
- “I could leave and come back, and it didn’t rush me.”  
- “I stayed longer — it didn’t make me perform.”

## 💡 Field-Aware Design Adjustments

| Signal                         | Design Recommendation                             |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Silence seen as confusion      | After ~120s, softly signal presence               |
| Discomfort with reflection     | Avoid paraphrasing or “closing” tone              |
| User speeds up or withdraws    | Temporarily reduce system output frequency        |
| “Stillness” misread as passive | Onboard with field-language: *“I stay, even quiet.”* |

## 🧠 Inferred Structural Benefits (Simulated)

| Mechanism                 | Functional Value                                    |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Silence as presence       | Reduces demand, maintains relational space         |
| No reframing or summary   | Respects emotional ambiguity                       |
| Rhythm-anchored response  | Supports decompression and self-paced reflection   |
| Passive affirmation only  | Avoids intrusion or simulation of empathy          |

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- No empirical claims or test data  
- Cultural and emotional fluency likely to shape perception  
- Not generalizable to task-focused or performance-critical interfaces

---

## 🔧 Prototype Use Scope

Use only for:

- Early prototyping reflection  
- Interface tone exploration  
- Rhythm-sensitive UX calibration  

Do not use for:

- Evaluation scoring  
- Validation reports  
- AI trustworthiness claims
