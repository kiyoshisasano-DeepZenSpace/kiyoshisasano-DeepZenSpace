# 🎵 Music Cognition Translation of Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)

## Overview

This directory presents the **music cognition translation** of *Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)* — a comprehensive reinterpretation of its linguistic, mathematical, and interactional framework into the domain of **rhythm perception, synchronization, and temporal cognition**.

The goal is not literal translation, but a **paradigmatic reconstruction**: mapping PLD’s core operators (𝒟, ℛ, 𝓛₁–𝓛₅) to rhythm-theoretical constructs such as entrainment, phase correction, temporal anticipation, and pulse resonance.

## 🔸 Conceptual Translation Map

| PLD Term | Music Cognition Equivalent | Measurement / Conceptual Anchor |
|-----------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Drift (𝒟) | Phase Deviation / Timing Error | Mean asynchrony, phase variance |
| Repair (ℛ) | Phase Correction / Re-entrainment | Correction gain, lag compensation |
| Latent Phase (𝓛₃) | Silent Beat Maintenance | Delay duration, internal pulse persistence |
| Resonance (𝓛₅) | Rhythmic Entrainment / Coupling | Phase Locking Index (PLI) |
| Cue | Predictive Signal / Temporal Marker | Event onset, attentional cueing |
| Segment | Beat / Cycle Boundary | ITI segmentation, meter perception |

## 🔬 Methodological Goals

1. Reframe **phase loop** processes as *rhythmic feedback systems* measurable in synchronization tasks.  
2. Model **latent structures** as *predictive internal oscillations* underlying silent anticipation.  
3. Translate PLD’s **Markov and operator frameworks** into empirical time-series models.  
4. Enable cross-domain interpretation between **linguistic phase repair** and **musical phase correction**.
