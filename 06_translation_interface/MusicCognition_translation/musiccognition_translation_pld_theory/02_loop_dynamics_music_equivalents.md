# 🔁 Loop Dynamics and Music-Cognitive Equivalents

## 1. Overview

This chapter translates the **five phase loops** (𝓛₁–𝓛₅) of *Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)* into the conceptual language of **music cognition**.  
Each loop is reframed as a **temporal process** governing perception, expectancy, and synchronization, forming a cyclical ecology of **drift, repair, latency, and resonance**.

PLD thus becomes a grammar of **musical timing**: a model describing how rhythmic agents lose, regain, and sustain temporal alignment.

## 2. Core Mapping Table

| PLD Loop | Music-Cognitive Process | Temporal Function | Empirical Analogue |
|-----------|------------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| **𝓛₁ – Segment** | Beat boundary detection | Defines rhythmic and metric units | Meter induction, beat segmentation |
| **𝓛₂ – Drift** | Phase deviation / expressive displacement | Generates micro-variation and drives correction | Asynchrony drift in tapping |
| **𝓛₃ – Latent** | Silent pulse continuation | Maintains internal rhythm during silence | Continuation tapping, silent-beat reproduction |
| **𝓛₄ – Repair** | Corrective phase realignment | Restores synchrony after deviation | Error correction gain (PCG) |
| **𝓛₅ – Resonance** | Entrainment coupling / groove coherence | Stabilizes rhythmic flow through repetition | Phase locking index (PLI), perceived groove |

## 3. Loop-by-Loop Translation

### 3.1 𝓛₁ — Segment Loop: Metric Framing

**Concept:** Establishes perceptual boundaries within rhythmic flow.  
**Equivalent:** Beat and meter segmentation.

Listeners infer a regular metric structure—defining the “beat” or “downbeat”—from periodicities in sound events.  
The segmentation loop delineates rhythmic units via **expectancy peaks**, shaping the temporal frame for subsequent drift and repair.

**Operational Examples:**
- Beat perception and tapping alignment accuracy  
- IOI clustering into metric groups  
- Temporal expectancy curves across cycles  

---

### 3.2 𝓛₂ — Drift Loop: Temporal Deviation

**Concept:** Represents instability in rhythmic coherence.  
**Equivalent:** Phase drift between internal pulse and external beat.

Drift (\(\phi = t_{resp} - t_{stim}\)) is not mere error, but the *dynamic tension* that gives rise to correction and expression.  
In performance, controlled drift produces **expressive timing**; in perception, excessive drift signals desynchronization.

**Measurement Anchors:**
- Mean asynchrony (ms)  
- Drift rate over time  
- Correlation with corrective latency  

**Representative Sources:** Repp (2005), Large & Jones (1999)

---

### 3.3 𝓛₃ — Latent Loop: Silent Expectancy

**Concept:** Describes the persistence of rhythmic expectancy during auditory absence.  
**Equivalent:** Internal beat maintenance across silence or delay.

The latent loop embodies the **continuation of entrainment** when no external signal is present.  
In continuation tapping, performers resume in-phase after silence, revealing the endurance of *temporal imagination*.

**Operational Measures:**
- Temporal error after silent gaps  
- Beat persistence ratio  
- Stability of IOI after continuation  

**Representative Sources:** Jones et al. (2002), Large & Jones (1999)

---

### 3.4 𝓛₄ — Repair Loop: Expressive Realignment

**Concept:** Models the correction of accumulated temporal deviation.  
**Equivalent:** Adaptive synchronization restoring entrainment.

Repair occurs when the performer or listener adjusts timing to minimize phase error:

\[
\Delta\phi_{t+1} = (1 - \alpha)\Delta\phi_t
\]

where \(\alpha\) = **correction gain** (0 < α < 1).  
Expressive repair distinguishes intentional expressive lag from automatic temporal correction.

**Empirical Indicators:**
- Lag-one autocorrelation slope  
- Asymmetry between advance/delay corrections  
- Stability of correction across tempi  

**Representative Sources:** Repp & Keller (2004), Palmer (1997)

---

### 3.5 𝓛₅ — Resonance Loop: Temporal Coupling and Flow

**Concept:** Captures the stabilization of rhythmic interaction through entrainment.  
**Equivalent:** Sustained phase coupling perceived as *groove* or *temporal flow*.

Resonance describes convergence toward a **phase-stable attractor**, where oscillatory agents share expectancy and movement:

\[
\frac{d\phi}{dt} = \omega_i - \omega_j + K\sin(\phi)
\]

Here \(K\) quantifies coupling strength, and the resulting **entrainment correlation (ρ)** indexes synchrony stability.

**Empirical Indicators:**
- Phase locking index (PLI)  
- Cross-correlation of IOI fluctuations  
- Mutual adaptation in duet performance  

**Representative Sources:** Keller & Appel (2010), Large (2008)

## 4. Inter-Loop Transitions and Temporal Ecology

Transitions between loops correspond to **state shifts** in rhythmic cognition—oscillations between instability and restoration.

| Transition | Cognitive Event | Behavioral Manifestation |
|-------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| 𝓛₁ → 𝓛₂ | Segmentation → Drift | Onset of expressive asynchrony |
| 𝓛₂ → 𝓛₄ | Drift → Repair | Corrective phase adjustment |
| 𝓛₃ → 𝓛₁ | Latent → Segment | Re-entry into rhythm after silence |
| 𝓛₅ → 𝓛₂ | Resonance decay | Over-adaptation leading to phase slip |

The network of loops forms a **recursive phase field**—a self-regulating system of rhythmic expectation, perturbation, and recovery.

---

## 5. Experimental Translation Framework

Each PLD loop corresponds to a measurable process in performance or perception:

| Loop | Paradigm | Dependent Variable | Expected Outcome |
|------|-----------|-------------------|------------------|
| **𝓛₁** | Beat segmentation | Accuracy, ERP latency | Periodicity at metrical peaks |
| **𝓛₂** | Perturbed tapping | Mean asynchrony drift | Progressive phase lag |
| **𝓛₃** | Silent continuation | Temporal error post-gap | Phase-consistent reentry |
| **𝓛₄** | Delayed feedback | Correction gain (α) | Partial compensation (0.3–0.6) |
| **𝓛₅** | Groove induction | Entrainment correlation (ρ) | Stable synchronization plateau |

These paradigms collectively operationalize the **loop grammar of rhythm**.

---

## 6. Synthesis

The five PLD loops—Segment, Drift, Latent, Repair, and Resonance—compose a **recursive entrainment model** of musical time.  
They describe how performers and listeners navigate between **expectation, deviation, and restoration**, forming the dynamic continuity we perceive as rhythm.

> *“Each beat is a negotiation—between prediction and return, between the silence that waits and the pulse that answers.”*
