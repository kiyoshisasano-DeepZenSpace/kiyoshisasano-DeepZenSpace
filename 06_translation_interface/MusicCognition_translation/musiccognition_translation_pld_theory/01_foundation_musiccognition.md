# üé∂ Foundations of Music Cognition Translation for Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)

## 1. Introduction

This chapter establishes the **foundational framework** for translating *Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)* into the disciplinary language of **music cognition**.  
Here, PLD is reconceived not as an interactional or linguistic system, but as a **temporal ecology** describing how rhythmic structures **drift**, **repair**, and **resonate** within musical perception and performance.

Our central assumption is that the *loops* (ùìõ‚ÇÅ‚Äìùìõ‚ÇÖ) of PLD correspond to distinct **phases of entrainment** in musical timing‚Äîprocesses through which performers and listeners sustain, deviate from, and restore temporal alignment.

## 2. From Phase Loop to Entrainment System

| PLD Concept | Music-Cognitive Equivalent | Description |
|--------------|----------------------------|--------------|
| **Drift (ùíü)** | Temporal deviation between internal pulse and external beat | Micro-timing displacement indicating loss of synchrony. |
| **Repair (‚Ñõ)** | Phase correction / expressive realignment | Adjustive return toward perceived temporal center. |
| **Latent Phase (ùìõ‚ÇÉ)** | Silent pulse persistence | Internal continuation of rhythm during auditory absence. |
| **Resonance (ùìõ‚ÇÖ)** | Entrainment coupling / mutual synchrony | Stabilization of shared temporal expectancy. |
| **Cue** | Anticipatory event onset | Predictive marker shaping attention and alignment. |
| **Segment** | Beat or metric boundary | Hierarchical unit defining rhythmic grouping. |

This mapping situates PLD‚Äôs operators within **rhythmic cognition**, transforming loop recursion into **cycles of temporal anticipation and recovery**.

## 3. Temporal Cognition as Predictive Entrainment

In musical contexts, timing is not reactive but **predictive**: listeners and performers maintain internal oscillations that anticipate forthcoming events.  
Under this view, PLD‚Äôs *drift‚Äìrepair‚Äìresonance* cycle captures the dynamics of **expectancy, deviation, and restoration** governing rhythmic behavior.

Formally, entrainment may be expressed as:

\[
\frac{d\phi}{dt} = \omega_i - \omega_e + K \sin(\phi)
\]

where  
- \(\phi\) = phase difference between internal and external oscillators  
- \(\omega_i, \omega_e\) = intrinsic and external frequencies  
- \(K\) = coupling strength (entrainment gain)

Changes in \(\phi\) correspond to musical **drift**, while the sine term represents **repair forces** that re-establish synchrony‚Äîyielding the perceptual stability experienced as **resonance**.

## 4. Structural Correspondence between PLD Loops and Musical Timing

| PLD Loop | Temporal Role | Cognitive Mechanism | Example Paradigm |
|-----------|----------------|--------------------|------------------|
| **ùìõ‚ÇÅ ‚Äì Segmentation** | Metric grouping | Perception of beat and measure | Beat perception tasks |
| **ùìõ‚ÇÇ ‚Äì Drift** | Temporal deviation | Accumulation of phase error | Perturbation tapping |
| **ùìõ‚ÇÉ ‚Äì Latent Phase** | Silent prediction | Internal continuation of pulse | Continuation tapping / gap completion |
| **ùìõ‚ÇÑ ‚Äì Repair** | Expressive correction | Adaptive phase realignment | Feedback delay adaptation |
| **ùìõ‚ÇÖ ‚Äì Resonance** | Stabilized coupling | Sustained entrainment and affective flow | Duet synchronization / groove induction |

These correspondences translate PLD‚Äôs formal hierarchy into **empirical phases of rhythmic cognition**, unifying perception, action, and temporal memory.

## 5. Cognitive Implications

- **Drift** quantifies the momentary loss of temporal stability‚Äîperceived as expressive micro-variation.  
- **Repair** denotes an intentional or automatic adjustment toward rhythmic equilibrium.  
- **Latent Phase** reveals continuity of expectancy during silence, grounding *temporal imagination*.  
- **Resonance** embodies the alignment of oscillatory attention across performers or between performer and pulse.  
- Collectively, these constitute a **recursive temporal field** where rhythm emerges from cycles of perturbation and restoration.

## 6. Mathematical Translation Schema

The following minimal operator mapping retains PLD‚Äôs dynamic form while embedding it in rhythmic cognition:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{D} &\Rightarrow \delta(t) = \partial_t(\phi) && \text{(tempo deviation)} \\
\mathcal{R} &\Rightarrow t(\mathcal{R}) = -K\sin(\phi) && \text{(correction latency)} \\
\mathcal{L}_3 &\Rightarrow \psi_{int}(t) && \text{(internal expectancy oscillator)} \\
\mathcal{L}_5 &\Rightarrow \rho(\phi,t) && \text{(entrainment correlation field)}
\end{aligned}
\]

Here, \(\rho\) expresses the *stability of synchrony*‚Äîa measurable correlate of **resonant entrainment** in ensemble timing.

## 7. Empirical Anchors in Music Cognition

| Domain | Key Metric | Representative Study |
|---------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Sensorimotor synchronization** | Phase correction gain (PCG) | Repp (2005); Repp & Su (2013) |
| **Temporal expectancy** | Entrainment index / IOI variance | Large & Jones (1999) |
| **Silent continuation** | Beat persistence ratio | Jones et al. (2002) |
| **Interpersonal coupling** | Entrainment correlation (œÅ) | Keller & Appel (2010) |

These metrics offer operational pathways for quantifying PLD-derived constructs within performance and perception studies.

## 8. Summary

The translation of PLD into music cognition frames **temporal coordination as a loop ecology**:  
each cycle of drift and repair contributes to the emergent stability of resonance.  
Rather than a linguistic metaphor, PLD becomes a **music-theoretical grammar of time**, explicating how rhythmic consciousness maintains coherence through continuous self-correction.
