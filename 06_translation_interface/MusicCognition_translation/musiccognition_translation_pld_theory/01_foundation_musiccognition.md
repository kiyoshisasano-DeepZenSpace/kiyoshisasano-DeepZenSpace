# üé∂ Foundations of Music Cognition Translation for Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)

## 1. Introduction

This chapter establishes the **foundational translation** of *Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)* into the domain of **music cognition**.  
Rather than interpreting PLD as a linguistic model, we reconstruct it as a **temporal interaction framework** describing how rhythmic structures drift, repair, and realign in perception and production.

The guiding hypothesis is that the *loops* (ùìõ‚ÇÅ‚Äìùìõ‚ÇÖ) in PLD correspond to **dynamic processes of entrainment** and **sensorimotor synchronization (SMS)** observed in musical timing and rhythm perception.

## 2. From Phase Loop to Entrainment System

| PLD Concept | Music Cognition Analogue | Description |
|--------------|--------------------------|--------------|
| Phase Drift (ùíü) | Phase deviation between internal oscillator and external beat | Represents temporal instability or desynchronization. |
| Repair (‚Ñõ) | Phase correction / period adjustment | Realignment after timing errors or asynchrony. |
| Latent Phase (ùìõ‚ÇÉ) | Internal beat continuity during silence | Persistence of internal pulse when no auditory input is present. |
| Resonance (ùìõ‚ÇÖ) | Entrainment resonance / mutual coupling | Reinforcement of temporal alignment through repetition. |
| Cue | Temporal marker or anticipatory signal | Predictive event guiding phase resetting. |
| Segment | Cycle boundary / perceptual grouping | Demarcation of rhythmic or metric unit. |

## 3. Temporal Cognition and Predictive Framework

In music cognition, timing behavior is often explained by **predictive oscillation models** ‚Äî listeners maintain internal temporal expectancies which align with external rhythms.  
PLD‚Äôs *loop structures* can thus be viewed as nested levels of **anticipation, deviation, and correction**.

Mathematically, entrainment can be represented as:

\[
\frac{d\phi}{dt} = \omega_i - \omega_e + K \sin(\phi)
\]

where:
- \(\phi\) = phase difference between internal and external oscillators  
- \(\omega_i, \omega_e\) = intrinsic and external frequencies  
- \(K\) = coupling strength (entrainment gain)

PLD‚Äôs **drift‚Äìrepair‚Äìresonance cycles** correspond to fluctuations in \(\phi\), modulated by context, attention, and prediction error.

## 4. Structural Correspondence between PLD and Temporal Entrainment

| PLD Loop | Temporal Function | Cognitive Mechanism | Example Paradigm |
|-----------|------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| ùìõ‚ÇÅ ‚Äì Segment Detection | Cycle demarcation | Beat and meter segmentation | Beat perception tasks |
| ùìõ‚ÇÇ ‚Äì Drift | Temporal deviation | Accumulation of phase error | Perturbation experiments |
| ùìõ‚ÇÉ ‚Äì Latent | Internal pulse maintenance | Temporal prediction during silence | Continuation tapping, gap detection |
| ùìõ‚ÇÑ ‚Äì Feedback | Phase correction | Reactive entrainment / re-synchronization | Tapping with feedback delay |
| ùìõ‚ÇÖ ‚Äì Resonance | Coupled oscillation stability | Mutual alignment and rhythmic flow | Duet entrainment, groove perception |

## 5. Cognitive Implications

- **Drift** reflects sensitivity to micro-timing perturbations.  
- **Repair** embodies corrective synchronization responses, analogous to *phase correction gain*.  
- **Latent phase** reveals predictive oscillatory activity sustained in silence.  
- **Resonance** captures emergent synchrony and affective flow.  
- Together, they define a **closed temporal feedback ecology**, aligning perception, prediction, and production.

## 6. Mathematical Translation Framework

We define a minimal mapping between PLD and temporal cognition operators:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{D} &\Rightarrow \partial_t (\phi) & \text{(Phase deviation)} \\
\mathcal{R} &\Rightarrow -K\sin(\phi) & \text{(Correction force)} \\
\mathcal{L}_3 &\Rightarrow \psi_{int}(t) & \text{(Internal oscillator state)} \\
\mathcal{L}_5 &\Rightarrow C(\phi,t) & \text{(Resonant coupling field)}
\end{aligned}
\]

This mapping preserves PLD‚Äôs dynamic topology while grounding it in **empirical rhythm theory**.

## 7. Experimental Anchors

| Empirical Domain | Key Metric | Relevant Work |
|------------------|-------------|----------------|
| Sensorimotor synchronization | Phase correction gain (PCG) | Repp (2005); Repp & Su (2013) |
| Rhythmic prediction | Temporal expectancy index | Large & Jones (1999) |
| Silence and continuation | Beat persistence ratio | Jones et al. (2002) |
| Coupled performance | Phase locking index (PLI) | Keller & Appel (2010) |

## 8. Summary

PLD, when reinterpreted through the lens of rhythm cognition, provides a **loop-based grammar of timing** ‚Äî explaining how musical structure is maintained, destabilized, and restored through cycles of drift and correction.

> *‚ÄúRhythm is not the absence of structure but the persistence of its return.‚Äù*
