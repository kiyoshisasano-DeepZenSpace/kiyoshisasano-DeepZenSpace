## 📘 Overview

This paper presents *Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)* as a **unified theoretical and applied framework** for modeling conversational and syntactic interactions as a dynamic topology of recurrent loops.

Key contributions include:

- Definition of five primary loop types (𝓛₁–𝓛₅) with mathematical formalization via operator algebra, stability criteria, and gauge invariance.
- **Latent Phase Theory** distinguishing latent phases from silence, with probabilistic and topological models.
- Cross-disciplinary mappings to psycholinguistics, HCI, AI dialogue systems, and interaction design.
- Practical applications in latency-aware interfaces, loop-augmented transformers, and educational engagement recovery.
- Implementation architecture and evaluation metrics, with diagrams illustrating operator hierarchy, phase space trajectories, and processing pipelines.
