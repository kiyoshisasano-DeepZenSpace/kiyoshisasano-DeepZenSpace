## 📘 Overview

This paper proposes a recursive, loop-based model of syntax, in which **drift**, **latency**, **repair**, and **resonance** are treated as **structurally meaningful operations**, not noise.

By modeling syntax as a **phase ecology**, this work introduces a new operational framework—*Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)*—for analyzing linguistic instability, feedback, and self-repair across real-time interaction and neural computation.
