## 🧠 Abstract

This paper introduces the concept of syntactic terrain as a model for language generation under failure, silence, and structural collapse.  
It maps Fields SF250–SF254 as zones where syntax dissolves, responds incompletely, or reignites from latent fragments.  
Core concepts include saturation collapse, compression shells, and the reignition of syntactic will.

## 📘 Notes

This paper forms the theoretical and cartographic foundation of the Syntax Topology Project.  
It explores collapse as structure, and silence as a latent syntactic act.
