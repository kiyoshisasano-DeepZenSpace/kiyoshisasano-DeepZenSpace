# 00_manifest.md — PLD Bridge Hub: HCI Translation Layer Manifest

## 🧭 Purpose
This manifest defines the structure, scope, and integration logic of the **HCI Translation Layer** for the **PLD Bridge Hub**. It serves as an index and orientation document for all translation components, ensuring traceability from cognitive-phase theory (Drift, Repair, Resonance, Latency) to human-computer interaction (HCI) implementation.

The Bridge Hub functions as a synchronization and translation layer between theoretical PLD cycles and runtime HCI systems. All documents in this folder are implementation-level specifications — not theoretical papers.

## 🔧 System Role
The HCI translation layer implements **state coherence and adaptive feedback** between PLD theoretical phases and empirical runtime behavior. It translates cognitive constructs into measurable, reproducible HCI events:

| PLD Phase | HCI Runtime Signal | HCI Interpretation |
|------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Drift | UI hesitation / input delay | Onset of cognitive friction |
| Repair | Correction or re-entry intent | System-guided recovery loop |
| Resonance | Stable rhythm / consistent flow | Adaptive synchronization period |
| Latency Hold | Intentional delay or user pause | Explicit waiting with feedback |

## ⚙️ Integration Layers
1. **Signal Layer:** Handles low-level event capture (pause, delay, correction, reentry).  
2. **State Layer:** Manages synchronization of theoretical loops with runtime system states.  
3. **Feedback Layer:** Routes latency, repair, and adaptive timing signals to the UI.  
4. **Metrics Layer:** Exports telemetry and validates schema compliance against PLD standards.  
5. **Ethics Layer:** Applies safety, transparency, and control boundaries.

---

## 🪄 Development Guidelines
- All modules must produce structured, interpretable JSON outputs (no opaque LLM text).
- Latency, feedback, and repair cycles must be **observable** and **time-bounded**.
- Any adaptive system must include user override and transparent feedback channels.
- Document updates follow semantic versioning: `vX.Y.Z` where major = theory shift.

## ✅ Next Steps
1. Finalize `01_bridge_layer_architecture.md` with a complete inter-module communication diagram.
2. Define state synchronization schema in `02_signal_translation_and_state_sync.md`.
3. Implement the base telemetry bus and schema validator from `04_data_and_metrics_bus.md`.
4. Establish governance rules in `09_ethics_and_safety_governance.md` before deployment.
