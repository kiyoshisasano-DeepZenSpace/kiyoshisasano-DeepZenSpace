## Overview

This repository presents the Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) translation of the Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD) theoretical framework.  
Originally developed as a formal model of temporal coordination, PLD is here rewritten entirely in HCI terminology — linking interaction rhythm, repair, and resonance to established theories by Suchman, Clark, Dourish, Norman, and others.

The translation provides a conceptual bridge between classical HCI theory, Conversation Analysis, and computational modeling.  
It is purely theoretical — no implementation or tool-specific content is included.

## Objectives

- Recast PLD into standard HCI vocabulary (turn-taking, grounding, repair, feedback, latency, etc.).  
- Connect PLD to existing HCI theories while making its novelty explicit.  
- Define operational, measurable constructs for coordination rhythm.  
- Offer a lexically stable framework for research, design, and analysis.

## Reading Order

1. **Part 1–2:** Context and theoretical foundation.  
2. **Part 3–4:** Core conceptual model and interaction loop.  
3. **Part 5:** Measurement and analytical framework.  
4. **Part 6:** Discussion and future research agenda.  
5. **Appendices:** Lexical governance and conceptual connectivity.

Each section is self-contained but designed for cumulative understanding.  
Appendix A and B can be cited independently for terminology or model reference.

## Key Concepts

- **Drift (𝒟):** Momentary misalignment in coordination.  
- **Repair (ℛ):** Interactional recovery restoring rhythm.  
- **Resonance (𝓛₅):** Sustained synchrony or entrainment.  
- **Latency (𝓛₃):** Temporal pause enabling prediction.  
- **Phase Loop:** Cyclical structure binding these phenomena across timescales.

These correspond to measurable features of temporal coordination in user–system interaction.

## Compatibility

- Fully written in Markdown (UTF-8) with GitHub-compatible Mermaid diagrams.  
- Emoji indicators (🟢🟡🔴) and mathematical notation (δ, t(ℛ), ρ, Δt₍L₃₎) are standards-compliant.  
- No external dependencies; viewable directly in the GitHub web interface.
