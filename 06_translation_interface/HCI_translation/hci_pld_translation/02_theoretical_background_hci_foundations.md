# Part 2 ‚Äî Core Concepts: Drift, Repair, Resonance, Latency, and Interaction States

## 2.1 Overview

In Human‚ÄìComputer Interaction (HCI), interaction unfolds as temporal co-regulation rather than a mere exchange of messages. Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD) reframes co-regulation as a small set of recurrent coordination loops‚Äîregular patterns that explain how coordination stabilizes, degrades, and re-emerges. This section translates PLD constructs into standard HCI terms with operational definitions and conceptual measurement. Throughout, we use the canonical symbol set established in Part 5:  
Œ¥ (drift magnitude), t(‚Ñõ) (repair latency), œÅ (resonance strength), Œît‚ÇçL‚ÇÉ‚Çé (latency duration), S (cycle stability). See Part 5, Table 5.3 for the metric glossary.

## 2.2 Interaction State and Phase Loop (ùìõ)

**Definition**  

- **Interaction State (phase)**: a locally stable configuration of turn-taking, grounding status, and activity orientation during a dialogue or interface episode.  
- **Phase Loop (ùìõ·µ¢)**: a recurrent coordination pattern governing transitions among such states. Loops are empirically detectable via timing, turn structure, and feature reuse.

| Loop ID | HCI Analogue | Primary Function |
|----------|---------------|------------------|
| L‚ÇÅ | Turn-opening / Segmentation | Detecting onset and boundaries |
| L‚ÇÇ | Breakdown ‚Üí Repair | Managing deviation from mutual understanding |
| L‚ÇÉ | Pre-utterance Latency | Holding or delaying articulation |
| L‚ÇÑ | Self-monitoring Repair | Within-turn self-correction |
| L‚ÇÖ | Alignment / Resonance | Re-establishing synchrony or shared rhythm |

These loops correspond to well-documented mechanisms in Conversation Analysis (turn-taking, repair) and HCI (feedback, affordances, grounding).

## 2.3 Drift (ùíü) ‚Äî Degradation of Alignment (cautious term)

**HCI Interpretation**  
Drift is a graded loss of coordination‚Äîthe current frame no longer predicts the next action with sufficient confidence. It aligns with breakdown (Suchman 1987), extends system-image mismatch (Norman) into a temporal gradient, and quantifies misalignment in grounding (Clark 1996).

### Operational Dimensions

| Dimension | Description | Indicative Measure (conceptual) |
|------------|--------------|---------------------------------|
| Semantic drift | Divergence in referential meaning/intent | Clarification requests per turn; semantic distance of reformulations |
| Structural drift | Breakdown in expected syntactic/task sequence | Deviations from planned path; wrong state transitions |
| Temporal drift | Desynchronization of timing and latency | Turn-gap distribution; response-delay variance |

**Onset rule (conceptual):** mark drift when one or more indicators exceed local baselines. Magnitude is summarized as Œ¥.

**Examples:**  
1. Voice: cut-offs + ‚Äúhuh?‚Äù tokens  
2. GUI: cursor stalls + undo clusters  
3. Collaborative editing: topic wobble + overlapping starts

## 2.4 Repair (‚Ñõ) ‚Äî Re-establishment of Grounding

**HCI Interpretation**  
Repair restores mutual intelligibility and course of action. In CA terms: self/other initiation and completion. In HCI: confirmation prompts, clarification dialogs, reformulations, undo.

### Taxonomy

| Type | Initiator | Mechanism | HCI Examples |
|------|------------|------------|---------------|
| Self-initiated self-repair (L‚ÇÑ) | User | Re-articulation before system acts | ‚ÄúWait, I mean‚Ä¶‚Äù, quick undo |
| Self-initiated other-repair | User ‚Üí System | Explicit re-query | Reformulated search |
| Other-initiated self-repair | System ‚Üí User | Clarification prompt | ‚ÄúDid you mean‚Ä¶?‚Äù |
| Other-initiated other-repair | System | Automatic correction | Spell-check, autocorrect |

### Measurement Concepts

- **t(‚Ñõ):** time from drift onset ‚Üí confirmed repair  
- **Repair depth:** number of sub-repairs to reach alignment  
- **Success ratio:** fraction of repairs that yield confirmation without renewed drift  

**Intuition:** Repair performs a gradient descent on misalignment until the coherence of the episode stabilizes.

## 2.5 Resonance (L‚ÇÖ) ‚Äî Alignment Through Echo (cautious term)

**HCI Interpretation**  
Resonance is alignment via echo‚Äîreusing lexical, structural, prosodic, gestural, or rhythmic features to consolidate common ground and often to hand off smoothly (Du Bois & Giora 2014). In HCI it corresponds to interactional entrainment and flow.

### Functional Mechanisms

- Lexical/syntactic echo (paraphrase, parallelism)  
- Prosodic/temporal entrainment (pacing match)  
- Affective alignment (tone mirroring)  
- Interactional handoff (seamless turn transfer)

### Conceptual Metrics

| Indicator | Meaning | HCI Proxy |
|------------|----------|------------|
| œÅ (resonance strength) | Degree of echo/entrainment | n-gram overlap; latency cross-correlation |
| ŒîœÅ/Œît (decay) | Stability of alignment | Slope of correlation decay |
| œÑ (transfer index) | Seamless handoff probability | Turn-transfer success rate |

**Failure case:** Degenerate resonance: surface echo without semantic progress (œÅ high, grounding unchanged) ‚Üí predicts renewed drift. Analysts should distinguish productive vs degenerate resonance.

## 2.6 Latency (L‚ÇÉ) ‚Äî Structured Silence (cautious term)

**HCI Interpretation**  
Latency is coordinated withholding‚Äîintention is present but articulation is delayed. It is not mere absence: latency can invite uptake, stage repair, or prevent premature commitment.

### Types

| Type | Interactional Role | Observable Marker |
|-------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Preparatory latency | Planning before action | In-breath, gaze fixation, hover, pen lift |
| Hesitation latency | Uncertainty / repair preface | Fillers; pause > baseline (e.g., > ~500 ms speech) |
| Systemic latency | Machine processing delay | Spinners, progress indicators |
| Conversational latency | Turn-exchange timing | Gap between turns (Stivers 2009) |

### Measurement Notes

- **Œît‚ÇçL‚ÇÉ‚Çé:** measured against local baselines (task, skill, culture)  
- Optimal windows vary by modality; beyond them, latency provokes temporal drift  
- Adaptive latency can be beneficial (reflection, self-repair)

**Cultural/experience note:** Pause norms differ cross-culturally; experts show shorter anticipatory latencies than novices. Always normalize within-participant/task.

## 2.7 Inter-relations: Drift, Repair, Resonance, Latency

A cyclic dynamic organizes the four constructs:

```
[Drift] ‚Üí [Repair] ‚Üí [Resonance] ‚Üí [Latency] ‚Üí [Drift]
```

- **Drift** signals loss of predictive fit (Œ¥‚Üë).  
- **Repair** reduces misalignment (t(‚Ñõ) characterizes responsiveness).  
- **Resonance** stabilizes alignment (œÅ‚Üë, ŒîœÅ/Œît ‚â§ 0).  
- **Latency** provides temporal scaffolding (Œît‚ÇçL‚ÇÉ‚Çé) for the next initiative.

This extends Clark‚Äôs grounding by adding temporal layers (latency, entrainment) and failure paths (resonance collapse ‚Üí renewed drift), consistent with CA repair organization and Dourish‚Äôs temporal embodiment.

## 2.8 Conceptual Measurement Summary

| Construct | Primary Metric | Interpretive Range | Typical Data Sources |
|------------|----------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| Drift (ùíü) | Œ¥: deviation rate (semantic/temporal/structural) | 0 = stable ‚Üí 1 = severe misalignment | Dialog logs, UI traces |
| Repair (‚Ñõ) | t(‚Ñõ), success ratio, depth | Short t(‚Ñõ) + high success = effective | Clarifications, undo/redo, re-queries |
| Resonance (L‚ÇÖ) | œÅ, ŒîœÅ/Œît, œÑ | œÅ > ~0.8 indicates strong entrainment | Feature reuse; timing correlation |
| Latency (L‚ÇÉ) | Œît‚ÇçL‚ÇÉ‚Çé vs baseline | Optimal ranges are context-dependent | Speech timing; hover/idle logs |
| Cycle Stability (S) | Resonant time / cycle time | Higher S = more sustained fluency | Segmented state sequences |

See Part 5 for model variants (Markov transitions; decay functions) and ethics notes on timing as a design parameter.

## 2.9 Theoretical Contribution (Recap)

- **Temporal grounding theory:** grounding is dynamic and looped, not binary.  
- **Multi-dimensional drift metric:** semantic/structural/temporal facets under one umbrella (Œ¥).  
- **Quantified repair/resonance:** bridges CA typologies with measurable HCI indicators (t(‚Ñõ), œÅ).  
- **Silence as phase:** latency becomes a designable temporal resource rather than a void.
