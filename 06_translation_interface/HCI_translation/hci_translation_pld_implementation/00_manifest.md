## 1. Purpose

This folder consolidates the **HCI-oriented translation** of the **Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)** implementation framework — turning theoretical and mathematical constructs into **empirically tractable, design-ready, and ethically grounded specifications** for Human–Computer Interaction research.

While the theoretical underpinnings of PLD (see `Part4_Theoretical_Contributions_HCI.md`, `Part5_Measurement_Framework_HCI.md`, and `AppendixA_HCI_Lexicon_Safe_Usage_Guide.md`) formalize the model, this translation layer focuses on **how to apply PLD operationally** in UX systems, experimental designs, and instrumentation pipelines.

## 7. Design Philosophy

PLD views *temporal drift* not as deviation, but as **an expressive signal of interaction rhythm**.  
This translation layer operationalizes that principle in HCI terms by enabling:

- **Controllable phase loops** (Drift → Repair → Reentry → Resonance)  
- **Quantifiable timing operators** (𝒟, ℛ, 𝓛₃, ℛ₅)  
- **Schema-driven observability** across UX and AI systems  
- **Cross-modal rhythm mapping** between human and computational pacing  
- **Ethical timing transparency** — rhythm is never hidden from the user
