## Title
**Ethics and Safe Usage Protocols for PLD–HCI Implementations**

---

## Overview
This document defines the **ethical and safety principles** for implementing *Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)* within human–computer interaction systems. It aligns loop-based interaction design with responsible AI practices, user autonomy, and transparent telemetry collection.

The intent is to ensure that all PLD-driven feedback loops remain:
- **Safe** (bounded, observable, reversible),
- **Respectful** (protecting user agency and privacy),
- **Interpretable** (transparent rhythm logic),
- **Accountable** (traceable and auditable).

---

## 1. Ethical Design Tenets

| Principle | Description | Example Implementation |
|------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| **Agency Preservation** | Users should always be able to exit or override the interaction loop. | Cancel button interrupts latency hold. |
| **Transparency** | Timing and feedback must communicate intent (“Pausing to confirm”). | Display visible message during latency hold. |
| **Non-Deception** | Do not simulate empathy or delay deceptively. | Latency holds must serve rhythmic pacing, not illusion. |
| **Privacy-by-Design** | All PLD telemetry must be pseudonymized before storage. | Use hashed `session_id` and anonymized context IDs. |
| **Safety Envelope** | Limit loop iterations and ensure graceful fallback after repair exhaustion. | Cap `repair_attempts ≤ 2` before escalation. |

> **Guideline:** Ethical interaction is a form of rhythm — users should always perceive control returning to them.

---

## 2. Safe Feedback Loop Boundaries

### 2.1 Loop Cap
Every PLD control loop (Drift → Repair → Reentry) must include **bounded iteration**.

```python
if drift_count >= 2:
    log_event("repair_failed")
    action = "handoff"  # safe exit
```

- **Cap soft repair attempts:** 2 maximum.  
- After failure → initiate *handoff* or *summary fallback*.  
- Do **not** recursively call reentry from repair within the same loop frame.

### 2.2 Timing Safety
Avoid “invisible waiting.” Latency holds must include perceivable cues (e.g., shimmer, text, or haptic pulse).

- Max **latency_hold = 1500 ms**
- Min **perceptual threshold = 300 ms**
- Any delay beyond **2.5 s** → must be justified by explicit message

---

## 3. Ethical Telemetry Practices

Telemetry is essential for rhythm evaluation, but must be **minimal, aggregated, and privacy-compliant**.

### Required Controls
- Log only **non-identifiable** metadata (`duration_ms`, `reason`, `event_type`).
- Store raw PLD events separately from session content.
- Apply differential privacy for long-term analytics.
- Maintain explicit *consent banner* when telemetry is user-linked.

### Logging Example
```json
{
  "event_type": "latency_hold",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-13T16:42:00Z",
  "metadata": {
    "duration_ms": 900,
    "reason": "soft_repair_probe"
  }
}
```

## 4. Human Oversight and Interpretability

Systems implementing PLD must remain **human-auditable**. Every feedback cycle should produce traceable evidence of cause and intent.

| Oversight Layer | Method | Description |
|------------------|--------|--------------|
| **Operational** | Event Logs | Drift, Repair, Reentry traces |
| **Design** | Audit Scripts | Schema validation against `pld_event.schema.json` |
| **Ethical** | Review Loop | Human-in-the-loop verifies safety envelope |
| **UX** | User Feedback | Surveys for perceived control and comfort |

> Interpretation is accountability. Every loop state must have an explanation path.

---

## 5. Safe Temporal Interaction Rules

### 5.1 Interaction Pacing
Maintain safe timing across all interfaces:
- *Latency holds*: 800–1500 ms (bounded)
- *Soft repairs*: ≤ 2 per drift episode
- *Reentry*: automatic only after explicit confirmation
- *Resonance echoes*: ≤ 900 ms after user cue

### 5.2 Loop Termination
- Always include termination condition for repeating patterns.
- `handoff` or `summary_mode` must finalize unresolved loops.
- Design recovery messages to reinforce user control:  
  *“I might be off. Would you like to reset?”*

---

## 6. AI Alignment and Ethical Resonance

PLD-based timing creates an *affective channel*. This rhythm must **not** manipulate emotion without consent.

- Never simulate delay to imply deeper cognition or empathy.
- Do not mimic user sentiment unless for accessibility mirroring (e.g., tone consistency).
- Resonance patterns must be **neutral or user-driven**.
- Human override (“pause”, “resume”, “exit”) must be active at all times.

> **Ethical resonance** means aligning with user tempo, not steering it.

## 7. Security & Failure Handling

| Risk Type | Safeguard | Example |
|------------|------------|----------|
| **Infinite Loop** | Repair cap enforcement | Limit clarification loops |
| **Data Exposure** | Pseudonymized telemetry | Remove personal data before logging |
| **User Confusion** | UI context restoration | Explicit reentry messages |
| **Misinterpretation** | Schema validation | Validate against event schema |

---

## 8. Validation Checklist

Before deployment, confirm that all conditions are satisfied:

- [x] `repair_attempts` limited to 2  
- [x] `latency_hold` < 1500 ms  
- [x] Drift/reentry events logged with timestamps  
- [x] Schema validation using `pld_event.schema.json`  
- [x] User can always terminate loop  
- [x] All telemetry anonymized

## 9. Accountability Framework

Each PLD–HCI system should register the following in its **ethics manifest**:

| Field | Example |
|-------|----------|
| Responsible Team | HCI Lab, University of Tokyo |
| Version | 1.0 |
| Last Audit | 2025-10-13 |
| Loop Cap Policy | repair_attempts ≤ 2 |
| Telemetry Storage | Encrypted / pseudonymized |
| Audit Contact | ethics@hcilab.example.org |

---

## 10. Final Reflection

Phase Loop Dynamics provides a rich temporal structure for adaptive, empathic computing. Its ethical foundation is rhythm itself: **bounded, interpretable, and reversible feedback**.

> *Safety in rhythm is not silence—it is synchronized care.*
