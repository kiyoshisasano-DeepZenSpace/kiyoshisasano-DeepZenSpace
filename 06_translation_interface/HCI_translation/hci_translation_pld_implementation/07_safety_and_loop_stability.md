## 1. Purpose

This document defines **loop stability**, **interaction safety**, and **temporal control thresholds** for systems implementing Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD) within HCI contexts.  
Its goal is to ensure rhythmic adaptation and recovery without entering unstable or unsafe feedback loops.

---

## 2. Safety Model Overview

PLD-based systems operate as **closed temporal feedback loops**, dynamically adjusting latency, pacing, and repair frequency based on user signals.  
To prevent oscillations or fatigue, each feedback tier must respect bounded timing and amplitude constraints.

### 2.1 Stability Equation (Simplified)

Let the correction function be:

```math
f_c(t) = α * drift(t−τ) − β * repair(t−τ)
```

System stability requires:

```math
|α/β| < 1  →  bounded correction (safe oscillation)
```

If correction exceeds unity, the loop may overcompensate, causing **repair storms** (repeated clarification prompts) or **user disengagement**.

---

## 3. Temporal Safety Thresholds

| Parameter | Recommended Range | Effect if Exceeded |
|------------|------------------|--------------------|
| `τ_latency_hold` | 700–1200 ms | Feels either impatient (<700) or sluggish (>1200) |
| `drift_detection_window` | 8–15 s inactivity | Missed or false drift detection |
| `repair_attempts_max` | ≤ 3 per context | Risk of escalation fatigue |
| `reentry_timeout` | ≤ 600 s | Prevents long-horizon stale recovery |
| `ρ_tempo_min` | ≥ 0.5 | Synchrony threshold for resonance stability |

---

## 4. Loop Monitoring Layers

### 4.1 Operator L3 (Adaptive Timing)
Controls pacing and latency modulation.

- Uses PID-like control over latency intervals.  
- Adjusts `τ_latency_hold` dynamically to maintain tempo resonance (`ρ_tempo ≈ 0.7`).  
- Emits `stability_warning` event if derivative term spikes (rapid oscillation).

### 4.2 Operator L4 (Error Recovery)
Monitors repair loop depth and escalation rate.

- Triggers **repair_escalation** after 3 failed repairs.  
- If unresolved: fallback to “soft exit” or “pause loop” state.  
- Sends `loop_suspension` event for log traceability.

### 4.3 Operator L5 (System-Level Safety)
Supervises meta-level dynamics across sessions.

- Aggregates error ratios (`repair_escalation_rate`, `latency_interrupt_rate`).  
- Applies **dynamic gain limiting** when overactivity detected.  
- Can impose a cool-down (temporal damping) of 3–5 s before next repair prompt.

## 5. Stability Control Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Drift Detection] --> B[Repair Trigger]
    B --> C[Resonance Feedback Loop]
    C --> D[Latency Hold Controller]
    D --> E[Loop Monitor (L5)]
    E -->|saturation| F[Gain Limiter]
    F -->|feedback| B
```

### Notes
- **Gain Limiter** ensures oscillations in user-system interaction are bounded.  
- **Loop Monitor** uses event stream analytics to detect overcompensation (too frequent repair).

## 6. Failsafe Conditions

| Condition | Detection | Action |
|------------|------------|--------|
| Continuous drift without repair | ≥ 3 drift events / 60 s | Trigger soft timeout or “pause loop” |
| Repair storm (rapid oscillations) | > 2 repair attempts in < 5 s | Apply temporal damping |
| User fatigue indicator | Low engagement + high latency | Enter passive mode (reduce prompts) |
| Resonance instability | ρ_tempo < 0.4 for 5+ turns | Recalibrate pacing algorithm |
| UI anomaly | Unresponsive or missing state | Log `ui_halt` event and suspend cycle |

---

## 7. Interaction-Level Safety

### 7.1 User Overload Prevention
- Never send more than **one clarification prompt** within 3 seconds.  
- Delay visual refresh or animation feedback when latency_hold active.  
- Use **soft repair hints** instead of forced dialog resets.

### 7.2 Temporal Consistency Cues
- Maintain steady tempo in pacing holds (±100 ms tolerance).  
- Provide perceptible rhythm markers (e.g., pulse animation or typing dots).  
- Avoid abrupt pauses that disrupt resonance.

### 7.3 Graceful Degradation
If system degrades (slow response, missing signals):

1. Suspend adaptive timing loops.  
2. Enter “passive observation” mode.  
3. Resume when event confidence stabilizes (e.g., NLU > 0.45).

---

## 8. Feedback Saturation Control

Feedback loops may saturate when corrective actions accumulate faster than user recovery.

**Detection:**  
```math
ΔRepairRate / ΔDriftRate > 1.2
```

**Action:**  
- Reduce α gain (repair sensitivity).  
- Introduce artificial latency_hold delay.  
- Freeze adaptive feedback for one turn.

---

## 9. Safety Telemetry (for Dashboard Monitoring)

| Event | Field | Expected Range | Trigger |
|--------|--------|----------------|---------|
| `stability_warning` | `loop_amplitude` | 0.0–1.0 | if > 0.8 |
| `loop_suspension` | `reason` | "repair_storm" / "ui_freeze" | immediate |
| `gain_limit_applied` | `gain_ratio` | 0.5–1.0 | upon saturation |
| `safety_reentry_block` | `cooldown_s` | 2–5 | during forced cooldown |
| `latency_hold` | `duration_ms` | 700–1200 | adaptive pacing |

---

## 10. Temporal Damping Algorithm (Pseudocode)

```python
if repair_rate > 1.2 * drift_rate:
    α *= 0.8  # reduce corrective gain
    insert_latency_hold(1000, reason="damping_phase")
    log_event("gain_limit_applied", {"gain_ratio": α})
```

This algorithm enforces soft damping when the feedback loop exhibits overshoot behavior.

---

## 11. Loop Safety Classification (Appendix A Alignment)

| Tier | Description | Example Control |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| **Tier 1 – Passive Observation** | No active repair, drift-only logging | analytics mode |
| **Tier 2 – Interactive Prompting** | Soft clarifications only | “Need help?” messages |
| **Tier 3 – Adaptive Timing** | Dynamic latency modulation | resonance pacing |
| **Tier 4 – Autonomous Repair** | Automatic reentry triggers | AI-initiated clarification |
| **Tier 5 – Meta-supervision** | Cross-loop governance | gain limiting, temporal damping |

Only **Tier ≤ 3** should be deployed in production environments unless explicit user consent is provided.

---

## 12. Safety Validation Protocol

1. Simulate 100 sessions with varying drift rates.  
2. Measure stability index (`|α/β|`) per session.  
3. Verify <5% exceed safe gain ratio.  
4. Log any repair storm or damping activation.  
5. Review dashboard for oscillatory patterns.  
6. Conduct human-in-the-loop validation for UX safety.

## 13. Emergency Control Commands (Developer API)

| Command | Function | Usage Context |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| `pause_loop()` | Suspend PLD adaptive cycle | Maintenance |
| `reset_gains()` | Restore α, β to baseline | Post-instability recovery |
| `freeze_feedback(n_turns)` | Temporarily disable adaptive corrections | Overload protection |
| `resume_loop()` | Resume adaptive mode after cooldown | Stabilization |
| `flush_logs()` | Export full safety telemetry | Post-mortem analysis |

## 14. Logging Contract for Safety Events

```yaml
event_type: safety_warning
timestamp: 2025-10-13T10:15:42Z
session_id: s9834-f1a9
metadata:
  loop_amplitude: 0.92
  reason: "repair_oscillation"
  action: "gain_limit_applied"
```

All safety-related events must include **loop amplitude**, **reason**, and **action** fields.
