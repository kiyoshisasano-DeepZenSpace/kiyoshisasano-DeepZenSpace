## üöÄ Fastest Path (90-minute version)

**For an initial evaluation:**

1. Read this Introduction (10 min)  
2. Skim Section 2 (10 min) ‚Äî focus on 2.1 and 2.7  
3. Read Section 3 (Core Concepts) (30 min) ‚Äî definitions only  
4. Read Section 5 (Measurement Framework) (20 min) ‚Äî operational metrics  
5. Read Section 6.2‚Äì6.3 (10 min) ‚Äî implications and limitations  

**Skip on first pass:**  
Section 4 (cycle details) and Appendices (reference material)

**After 90 minutes, you should know:**
- Whether PLD is relevant to your research  
- How it differs from Suchman / Clark / Dourish  
- What measurement constructs it proposes

## Intended Readers

- üü¢ **HCI theorists who have read:**
  - Suchman (1987) *Plans and Situated Actions* ‚Äî Chapters 1‚Äì3  
  - Clark (1996) *Using Language* ‚Äî Chapters 3‚Äì5 (on grounding)  
  - Dourish (2001) *Where the Action Is* ‚Äî Part I  

  **Self-check:** Can you briefly explain   
  ‚Äì ‚Äúbreakdown‚Äù (Suchman),    
  ‚Äì ‚Äúcommon ground‚Äù (Clark), and    
  ‚Äì ‚Äúembodiment‚Äù (Dourish)   
  in 1‚Äì2 sentences each? If yes, you have sufficient theoretical grounding.

- üü° **Conversation-analysis readers:** Familiarity with repair organization and preference structures is helpful, but Section 2 summarizes essentials.

- üü¢ **Quantitative HCI researchers:** Only a basic grasp of statistics (e.g., correlation œÅ) is required.

## 1. Introduction

Human‚ÄìComputer Interaction (HCI) explains how people and systems coordinate action over time.  
Canonical theories emphasize situated action (Suchman 1987), grounding (Clark 1996), embodied interaction (Dourish 2001), affordances and feedback (Norman 2013), and turn-taking and repair (Sacks et al. 1974). Together they show that interactional progress is jointly constructed, locally contingent, and temporally organized. What remains missing is a compact account of how coordination drifts, recovers, and stabilizes‚Äîwith silence and echo treated as structural resources rather than noise.

**Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)** fills this gap by reframing interaction as motion through a small set of recurrent coordination states linked by recurrent patterns (‚Äúloops‚Äù) in a coordination state-space.

---

### 1.1 Motivation and Theoretical Gap
PLD offers a temporal-mechanistic bridge among Suchman, Clark, and Dourish. It provides a state-space model of coordination that captures how interactions degrade (drift), recover (repair), and stabilize (resonance) through predictive latency (ùìõ‚ÇÉ).

---

### 1.2 Core Premise of PLD in HCI

PLD treats coordination as motion through recurrent states; each state transition constitutes an empirically recognizable **temporal affordance**.

- **Phase (Œ£)** = interaction state ‚Äî a recognizable configuration of turn-taking, grounding status, and activity orientation.  
- **Loop (ùìõ·µ¢)** = recurrent coordination pattern connecting states.  
- **Drift (ùíü)** = grounding deficit / coordination breakdown.  
- **Repair (‚Ñõ)** = recovery work that re-establishes a shared next step.  
- **Resonance (ùìõ‚ÇÖ)** = alignment through echo to stabilize common ground.  
- **Latency (ùìõ‚ÇÉ)** = coordinated withholding that stages repair or invites uptake.

### 1.3 Novel Contributions of This Translation

1. Formalizes coordination as a phase-loop cycle, bridging qualitative and quantitative HCI.
2. Defines operational metrics (Œ¥, t(‚Ñõ), Œît‚ÇçL‚ÇÉ‚Çé, œÅ) for empirical validation.
3. Integrates temporal affordance into feedback timing.
4. Establishes a lexically stable framework (drift / repair / resonance) for design analysis.

### 1.4 Scope and Limitations

The translation addresses theoretical constructs and measurable indicators only.
Implementation, algorithmic optimization, and application-specific evaluation are beyond scope.

---

### 1.5 Reading Roadmap

The following sections develop the translation progressively:

- Part 2: Situates PLD within HCI foundations.
- Part 3: Defines core constructs.
- Part 4: Models the temporal cycle.
- Part 5: Operationalizes measurement.
- Part 6: Synthesizes implications and future work.
  Appendices provide term governance and conceptual maps.
