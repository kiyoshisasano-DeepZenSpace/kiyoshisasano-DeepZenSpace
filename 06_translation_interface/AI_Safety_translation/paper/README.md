## Overview

**Calibrated Transparency (CT)** is a formal AI safety framework integrating recursive value learning, adversarial-robust verification, and cryptographic auditability.  
It provides **mechanistically grounded assurance** for safe AI governance through measurable transparency and risk composition.

## Abstract

I propose **Calibrated Transparency (CT)**, a formal framework that integrates recursive value learning, adversarial-robust verification, and cryptographic auditability to operationalize AI safety governance. Unlike descriptive transparency, CT establishes **causal pathways** from calibration mechanisms to safety guarantees through:

1. State-consistent Lyapunov verification with runtime monitoring  
2. Robustness against metric gaming and deceptive alignment with measurable detection bounds  
3. **Operationally defined metrics** with reproducible protocols  
4. Policy-aligned implementation mappings  

CT synthesizes 2020–2025 research across preference learning (Kim et al., 2025), Lyapunov and barrier-certificate verification (Henzinger et al., 2025), cryptographic auditing (Balan et al., 2025), and governance frameworks (NIST AI RMF, EU AI Act, ISO/IEC 42001).
