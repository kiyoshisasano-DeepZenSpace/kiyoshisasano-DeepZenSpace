# 🧭 PLD–Social Systems Mapping Index (v1.0)

> **Purpose:** This document is the *lexical and theoretical hub* of the Social Alignment Translation (Bridge) layer.  
> It specifies how **Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)** concepts map to **social systems theory**, **network science**, and **trust & cooperation** terminology.  
> All subsequent files in `translation_pld_bridge_social/` inherit these mappings and symbol conventions.

## 1. Orientation & Scope

The **bridge layer** connects the formal PLD theory (see `AI_SocialAlignment_translation/translation_pld_theory/`) to a social-science-ready reading kit.  
The mapping below recasts loop operators and phase constructs as **coordination processes** with measurable trust and synchronization dynamics.

**Primary Reference Fields (fixed):**
- Luhmann (1984) *Social Systems* — autopoietic communication
- Barabási (2002) *Linked* — network topology, cascades
- Lewicki & Bunker (1996) — trust repair cycles
- Strogatz (2003) *Sync* — coupled oscillators, synchronization

> Exclusions: Political ideology, cultural criticism, normative ethics (see translation rules).

## 2. Core Mapping — PLD → Social Systems

| PLD Concept | Symbol | Social Interpretation | Operational Role |
|-------------|--------|-----------------------|------------------|
| **Drift** | δ | **Trust erosion / communication noise** | Divergence of expectations inside communication loops |
| **Repair** | t(ℛ) | **Reconciliation period** | Time window for trust restoration |
| **Resonance** | ρ | **Synchronization / network coherence** | Phase-locking of collective expectations |
| **Latent Phase (𝓛₃)** | Δt₍L₃₎ | **Normative latency / decision delay** | Hesitation interval before cooperative action |
| **Alignment** | S | **Systemic stability** | Macro-level coordination equilibrium |
| **Phase Space (Σ)** | — | **Communication domain / subsystem** | Boundary of interaction (institutional or situational) |
| **Loop (𝓛ᵢ)** | — | **Social feedback cycle** | Iterative pattern of drift→repair→resonance |

## 3. Symbol Conversion Guide

| Symbol | Social Variable | Definition |
|--------|------------------|-----------|
| δ | Trust erosion rate | Speed of misalignment accumulation |
| t(ℛ) | Reconciliation time | Mean time to restore alignment after rupture |
| ρ | Synchronization coefficient | Strength of phase coherence across actors |
| Δt₍L₃₎ | Latency interval | Normative delay between detection and action |
| S | Stability index | Overall coordination potential of the system |

**Derived Indicators** (used across this folder):
- **Drift–Repair Efficiency:** \( \mathrm{DRE} = \delta / t(\mathcal{R}) \)  
- **Normalized Coherence:** \( \mathrm{NC} = 
ho / S \)

## 4. Classical Anchors (Mandatory Table)

| Classical Social Theory | Core Mechanism | PLD Reframing | Key Variable |
|-------------------------|----------------|---------------|--------------|
| Luhmann (1984) | Autopoiesis | Drift = communication noise | δ |
| Barabási (2002) | Scale-free networks | Resonance = synchronized cascades | ρ |
| Lewicki & Bunker (1996) | Trust repair | Repair = trust restoration | t(ℛ) |
| Strogatz (2003) | Synchronization | Latency = phase lag | Δt₍L₃₎ |

---

## 5. Analytical Dimensions

| Level | Description | Typical Indicator |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Micro** | Dyadic trust interaction | repair duration; trust gain per cycle |
| **Meso** | Cluster / community synchronization | modularity; ρ coherence |
| **Macro** | System-wide stability | S equilibrium; cascade containment |

## 🧩 Meta-Cognitive Checkpoint (for Prof. Elena Morales)

- Can **δ** and **ρ** be co-estimated on the same interaction graph without confounding cascade size?  
- Under what **Δt₍L₃₎** regimes does **S** (stability) remain invariant to degree heterogeneity?
