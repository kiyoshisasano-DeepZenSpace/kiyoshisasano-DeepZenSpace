# 🌐 PLD Bridge — Social Systems Translation (v1.0)

> “From syntactic loops to social feedbacks — PLD as a model of trust, repair, and synchronization.”  
> — *DeepZenSpace Translation Ecology, 2025*

## 1. Overview

This bridge repository translates **Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)** from interactional linguistics and system design into the domain of **social systems theory**, **network science**, and **trust dynamics**.

It provides a **conceptual and mathematical scaffold** for interpreting PLD operators — *Drift, Repair, Resonance, Latency* — as feedback mechanisms of **social coordination**.

**Target Reader:**  
> Prof. Elena Morales (model persona) — A mid-career researcher in social systems, with familiarity in Luhmann, Barabási, and Lewicki’s trust theory.

## 3. Theoretical Context

PLD’s **loop-based architecture** aligns with established social theories:

| Theorist | Concept | PLD Analogue | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Luhmann (1984)** | Autopoietic communication | Drift & Repair | Trust erosion and restoration as recursive loops |
| **Barabási (2002)** | Scale-free networks | Resonance | Synchronization cascades in social systems |
| **Lewicki & Bunker (1996)** | Trust repair model | Repair operator ℛ | Transition between distrust → cautious trust → stable trust |
| **Strogatz (2003)** | Coupled oscillators | Latent synchronization | Norm-based phase alignment across agents |

## 4. PLD → Social Reframing Map

| PLD Operator | Social Interpretation | Observed Variable | Timescale |
|---------------|----------------------|------------------|------------|
| **𝒟 (Drift)** | Trust erosion rate | δ | Daily / Weekly |
| **ℛ (Repair)** | Trust restoration dynamics | t(ℛ) | Short-term cycles |
| **𝓛₃ (Latency)** | Normative delay tolerance | Δt₍L₃₎ | Decision interval |
| **𝓛₅ (Resonance)** | Synchronization / trust echo | ρ | Network cascade phase |
| **S (Stability)** | Collective coherence index | — | Macro scale |

These mappings allow PLD’s algebraic framework to describe **social feedback loops** and **systemic adaptation**.

## 6. Example Scenarios

### 🏢 Organizational Trust Dynamics
- **Drift (δ):** Coordination breakdown in remote teams  
- **Repair (ℛ):** Reestablishment of shared goals via transparent communication  
- **Resonance (ρ):** Alignment of work rhythms and confidence levels  

### 🌐 Online Network Synchronization
- Information cascades as **resonance waves**  
- Trust decay modeled via **drift gradient**  
- Collective repair through moderation and feedback cycles  

### 🧭 Civic & Institutional Trust
- **Normative latency (Δt₍L₃₎)** = tolerated delay in government responses  
- **Stability (S)** = equilibrium between responsiveness and overload

## 7. Reviewer Checkpoints

> For readers (e.g., Prof. Morales) evaluating PLD as a social theory translation:

1. Does the framework preserve **autopoietic closure** while enabling network-level coupling?  
2. Are **trust repair** and **communication repair** modeled under the same recursive principle?  
3. Can **synchronization coherence (ρ)** explain collective adaptation phenomena?  
4. Is the **measurement framework** sufficiently generalizable for institutional data?
