## 📘 Translation Rules — Social Alignment PLD Edition (v1.0)

> *Purpose:*  
> To ensure stable, minimal, and discipline-consistent translation of **Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)** into the domain of **Social Alignment Theory** — with clear lexical boundaries and symbol consistency.

---

## 1. Translation Philosophy

- Translate **structure**, not **surface**.  
  Preserve the relational logic of PLD (loops, feedbacks, latencies) while replacing cognitive or linguistic terminology with **social-dynamic analogs**.
- Maintain **semantic isomorphism**:  
  Each PLD construct (𝓛₁–𝓛₅, Drift, Repair, Resonance, Latency) must have a **one-to-one counterpart** in the social domain.
- Keep the text readable within **two hours total**; avoid extensive implementation or data examples.

## 2. Domain Boundary Rules

| Category | Allowed | Excluded |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Discipline Scope** | Sociology, Network Science, Trust Dynamics, Organizational Studies | HCI, UX, Cultural Criticism, Political Theory |
| **Tone / Style** | Academic (AJS-style) | Journalistic, Normative, Critical |
| **Focus** | Systems, Feedbacks, Trust Loops | Ethics, Morality, Ideology |
| **Data Scale** | Group to Network (24h–weekly) | Individual psychology, Macro-political models |

## 3. Symbol and Variable Mapping

| Symbol | Meaning | Original PLD Term | Social Translation |
|--------|----------|------------------|--------------------|
| δ | Drift amplitude | Drift (𝓓) | Degree of social disalignment / trust erosion |
| t(ℛ) | Repair time constant | Repair (ℛ) | Time to relational recovery |
| ρ | Phase synchrony coefficient | Resonance (𝓛₅) | Degree of mutual coordination |
| Δt₍L₃₎ | Latency interval | Latent Phase (𝓛₃) | Delay before cooperative re-entry |
| S | Stability index | Alignment (𝓛₁–𝓛₅ aggregate) | Group-level equilibrium measure |

> All variables are constrained to real, normalized values between 0–1, unless otherwise noted.

## 4. Lexical Conversion Guide

| PLD Term | Social Alignment Equivalent | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------------------|-------|
| **Drift** | Trust Erosion / Communication Deviation | Interpreted as deviation in expectation coherence |
| **Repair** | Trust Restoration / Conflict Recovery | Structural return to baseline confidence |
| **Resonance** | Synchrony / Collective Rhythm | Repetition of aligned action patterns |
| **Latency** | Cooperative Delay / Hesitation | Pause before realignment or mutual confirmation |
| **Cue** | Social Signal / Relational Trigger | Event that reinitiates trust or coordination |
| **Segment** | Interaction Episode | Locally bounded cooperative act |
| **Alignment** | Normative Equilibrium | Stable shared frame or consensus period |

---

## 5. Mathematical Conventions

- Time domain is expressed in **days or weeks**, not milliseconds.  
  (e.g., t(ℛ) = 3.4 days → average recovery from trust breach)
- Stochastic notation follows **Wiener process form**, but interpreted socially:  
  \[
  dX_t = θ(μ - X_t)\,dt + σ\,dW_t
  \]
  where \(X_t\) represents **collective trust level**.
- ρ (synchrony) derived from **phase-locking value** across agents’ actions.

## 6. Prohibited Elements

- ❌ No reference to neural, cognitive, or interface processes.  
- ❌ No speculative ethics or moral prescriptions.  
- ❌ No affective terminology (“empathy”, “emotion regulation”, etc.).  
- ❌ No implementation guidance for AI or UI.

Only **systems-theoretic** and **interaction-dynamic** language is allowed.

---

## 7. Structural Constraints

- Each markdown chapter (01–05) must include:
  - An **introductory definition**
  - A **loop-level correspondence table**
  - A **quantitative or relational formulation**
  - A **short interpretive paragraph**
- Maximum length per chapter: **1,500–1,800 words** (readable in ≤20 min).

## 8. Citation & Attribution

When referencing original PLD sources, use:
> *“Adapted from Phase Loop Dynamics (Language Systems Collective, 2025)”*  
No full quotation of mathematical appendices beyond necessary loop operators.

## 9. Compliance Review Checklist

Before finalizing each file:
- [ ] Domain scope verified (Sociology/Network Science only)
- [ ] Lexical conversions follow mapping table
- [ ] No cross-domain leakage (HCI, Cognitive Science)
- [ ] Mathematical notation normalized (δ, ρ, t(ℛ), Δt₍L₃₎, S)
- [ ] Reading time ≤ 20 min

> “Translate rhythm into interaction; silence into delay; syntax into structure.  
>  In the social domain, every loop speaks through trust, drift, and recovery.”
