## 1. Purpose & Context

This folder translates **Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)** — originally formulated in linguistic and interactional terms —  
into the domain of **Social Alignment Theory**, focusing on **trust loops**, **coordination rhythms**, and **collective repair**.

The objective is to construct a **Social Systems Theory–compatible framework** for understanding how  
trust, communication, and synchronization unfold across social networks.

| Original Domain | Target Domain | Theoretical Frame |
|------------------|---------------|------------------|
| Linguistic Phases | Social Feedback Cycles | Luhmann (1984), Barabási (2002) |
| Cognitive Latency | Trust Latency | Lewicki & Bunker (1996) |
| Resonant Syntax | Collective Resonance | Strogatz (2003) |

## 4. Core Translation Table

| PLD Symbol | Social Interpretation | Description |
|-------------|------------------------|--------------|
| δ | **Trust Erosion Rate** | Degree of communication drift or misalignment |
| t(ℛ) | **Repair Period** | Average recovery time after trust rupture |
| ρ | **Synchronization Coefficient** | Strength of mutual coordination |
| Δt₍L₃₎ | **Latency Interval** | Delay between expectation and cooperative action |
| S | **Stability Index** | Equilibrium of alignment across actors |

> The S-PLD model assumes normalized values (0–1) and periodic cycles (daily to weekly).

## 5. Conceptual Summary

**Social Phase Loop Dynamics (S-PLD)** reframes linguistic “phases” as **trust-based feedback cycles**:

| Loop | Function | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| 𝓛₁ | Recognition of interaction onset | Greeting, initiation |
| 𝓛₂ | Drift–Repair loop | Miscommunication → clarification |
| 𝓛₃ | Latent phase (trust delay) | Hesitation before cooperation |
| 𝓛₄ | Reflexive feedback | Self-check, post-action correction |
| 𝓛₅ | Alignment–Resonance | Synchronization, shared rhythm |

Together, these loops describe a **self-organizing social system**  
capable of sustaining coherence through continual correction and resonance.

## 6. Figure Reference

**File:** `figures/loop_map_social.svg`  
A visual schema of S-PLD loops:

- **Nodes:** Norm Pause, Pending Decision, Reconciliation Signal, Collective Act, Trust Erosion, Trust Repair, Coordination Cohesion.  
- **Loops (𝓛₁–𝓛₅):** Represent transitions among hesitation, signal, drift, and repair states.  
- **Interpretation:** The system oscillates through uncertainty and restoration, maintaining dynamic trust equilibrium.

## 7. Theoretical Anchors

| Classical Theory | Core Mechanism | S-PLD Mapping |
|------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Luhmann (1984) *Social Systems* | Autopoiesis | Drift = communication noise |
| Barabási (2002) *Linked* | Scale-free networks | Resonance = synchronized cascades |
| Lewicki & Bunker (1996) | Trust repair | Repair = relational recovery |
| Strogatz (2003) *Sync* | Synchronization | Latency = phase lag |

---

## 8. Style & Constraints

- Academic English, sociology-oriented tone (AJS-compatible).  
- Avoid HCI, UX, or cognitive references.  
- Keep reasoning within social systems, networks, and trust theory boundaries.  
- Reading level: late MA to early postdoc (Prof. Elena Morales persona).
