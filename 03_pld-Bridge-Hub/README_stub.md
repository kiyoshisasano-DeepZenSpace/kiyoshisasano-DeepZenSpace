Revision notes (2025-08-09)
- Add Quick Access and See also to make this folder self-sufficient for partners.
- Keep collaboration docs centralized in 05_field_stewardship.

# ðŸ§  PLD-Bridge Hub

**One-line role:** The hub that connects **PLD theory (01)** to **implementation kits (02)** so partners can start from *this* folder only.

PLD models dynamic user or cognitive states through structured cycles of **Pause** and **Drift**, forming coherent loops that support repair and reentry.
