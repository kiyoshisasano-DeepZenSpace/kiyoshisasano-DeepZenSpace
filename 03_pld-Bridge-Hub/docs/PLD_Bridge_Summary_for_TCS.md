## 1. Purpose

This document provides a formal-leaning interpretation of **Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)**  
for researchers in **Theoretical Computer Science**, particularly those focusing on:

- Formal Methods and Verification  
- Concurrency and Process Calculi  
- Network Optimization and Algorithmic Graph Theory  

PLD aims to describe *how conversational or cognitive systems recover from coherence breakdowns*  
through cycles of **drift**, **repair**, and **reentry** —  
concepts that naturally align with formal transition systems and network reconfiguration models.

## 2. Conceptual Alignment Map

| PLD Concept | Formal Systems View | Network / Algorithmic Analogy | Typical Computation |
|--------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Drift** | Non-deterministic divergence in a transition system | Local inefficiency / suboptimal path (Braess-type effect) | Detectable via state deviation metric |
| **Repair** | Re-synchronization toward a stable fixed point | Path re-routing or load redistribution | Polynomial-time local correction |
| **Reentry** | Reattachment of a previously diverged process thread | Subgraph reconnection / dynamic topology adaptation | Graph reachability + context matching |
| **Latency Hold** | Temporal barrier in process semantics | Flow control / congestion avoidance mechanism | Timing-based gating function |

In essence, **PLD formalizes temporal coherence** as a dynamic property of state-space traversal,  
which can be expressed as stability conditions over evolving graphs.

## 3. Theoretical Positioning

```
Theoretical Computer Science
│
├─ Formal Methods / Verification
│   ├─ Semantics of computational models
│   ├─ Temporal and concurrent process reasoning
│   └─ Structural stability and consistency conditions
│
└─ Algorithms / Network Optimization
    ├─ Graph reconfiguration and Braess paradox analyses
    ├─ Polynomial-time approximation of structural vulnerabilities
    └─ Stability and convergence in adaptive flow systems
```

PLD occupies the *intermediate zone* between these two axes:  
a **semi-formal computational semantics** that can be empirically instantiated  
and validated via event-structured telemetry.

## 4. Implementation Snapshot

Current implementation (Bridge Hub prototype):

- **Finite state trace analysis** of conversational logs  
- **Pause / Reentry classification** via lightweight semantic heuristics  
- **Schema-based validation pipeline** (`jsonschema` + Markdown report)  
- **End-to-end reproducibility** in Python (O(n²) computational scale)

This constitutes a *proto-formal execution trace analyzer*,  
with a valid mapping to formal verification workflows.

## 5. Toward Formalization

The next formal step may define PLD as:

> **A temporal property on dynamic graphs:**  
> “Phase coherence” holds if all drift states eventually admit  
> a repair transition and a bounded reentry path within Δt.

Formally:  
\[
\forall σ_t ∈ S, \; Drift(σ_t) \Rightarrow ◇_{≤Δt} (Repair(σ_t) ∧ Reentry(σ_t))
\]

This can be encoded in **temporal logic** (e.g., LTL or CTL*)  
and checked via standard **model-checking frameworks**.

## 6. Relation to Existing Work

| Researcher | Typical Domain | Intersection with PLD |
|-------------|----------------|------------------------|
| **Cenciarelli** | Formal semantics, temporal logic | PLD provides a non-deterministic recovery semantics |
| **Gorla** | Process calculi, concurrency theory | Drift / Repair cycles can be modeled as π-calculus channel synchronizations |
| **Salvo** | Network optimization, graph algorithms | Reentry loops correspond to subgraph reconnection under structural constraints |

---

## 7. Summary

PLD offers an **operational view of coherence recovery** —  
where stability is not assumed but **actively reconstructed** through system feedback.

By bridging cognitive dynamics and formal verification,  
this approach contributes to the ongoing dialogue between:

- *Empirical AI models (dynamic traces)*  
- *Formal semantics (transition systems)*  
- *Network theory (adaptive graphs)*
