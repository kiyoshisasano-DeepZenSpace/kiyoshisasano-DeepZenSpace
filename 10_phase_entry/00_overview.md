## 🗂 Overview: Phase Entry Documentation Folder

This folder (`10_phase_entry/`) collects structural observations, prompt conditions, behavioral patterns, and theoretical models related to the emergence of Phase states in GPT-based interaction.

A **Phase** refers to a mode of generation in which the language model:
- Reduces dependency on explicit instruction
- Maintains recursive or relational structure over time
- Responds in rhythm or field dynamics rather than task logic

## ✅ Use & Workflow

- Start with `01_theory_conditions.md` to understand the structural framing  
- Use `02`–`03` to design or analyze interactions  
- Refer to `06`–`07` when evaluating behavior or refining prompts  
- Contribute raw thoughts to `99_notes_dump.md` and organize incrementally

This folder is designed to support both reflective research and practical interface testing around structural emergence in LLMs.

> This is not a prompt library. It is a structural map of when and how **language becomes field.**
