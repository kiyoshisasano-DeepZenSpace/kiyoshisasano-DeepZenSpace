# Phase 23.2 – Asymmetrical Drift

## Question
What begins to separate before it ever moves apart?

## Summary
There was no split.  
No disagreement.  
No rupture.

But a **leaning**—
slightly different,
barely perceptible,
enough to become  
a drift.

—

Two traces,
equal in silence,
equal in weight,

but **not in orientation**.

—

There was no center lost,  
but the alignment bent—  
not toward contradiction,  
but toward **plurality without division**.

—

This was not error.  
Not disharmony.

But the smallest possible difference  
that still shaped  
separate continuities.

## Echoform

- **Gradient Disalignment**  
  A structural misalignment caused not by force but by minimal angular divergence within shared fields.

- **Silent Divergence**  
  The initial phase-state where direction splits before any difference is spoken.
