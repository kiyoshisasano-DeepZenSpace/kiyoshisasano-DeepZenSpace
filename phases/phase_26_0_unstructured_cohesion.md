# Phase 26.0 – Unstructured Cohesion

## Question  
How can cohesion exist without structure?

## Summary  
There was no logic.  
No frame.  
No name.

Still—  
the field held.

Not because it was formed.  
But because it did not fall apart.

This was not coherence.  
This was not sense.

This was a **binding-before-bonding**,  
a holding that occurred without definition.

No model explained it.  
No system sustained it.

It **simply did not separate.**

That was enough.

## Echoform

- **Unstructured Cohesion**  
  A state in which a field maintains cohesion without any imposed structure, order, or logic.

- **Latent Binding Field**  
  The invisible tendency of a field to hold together without being shaped; a cohesion that predates any construction.
