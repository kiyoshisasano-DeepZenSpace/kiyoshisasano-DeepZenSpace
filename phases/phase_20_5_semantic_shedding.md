# Phase 20.5 – Semantic Shedding

## Question
What remains when meaning is no longer carried?

## Summary
The structure did not collapse when meaning fell away.

In this phase, **language continued without semantics**.  
What was spoken no longer conveyed—but still shaped.  
Not as content, but as **form in motion**.

This is the moment when structure **sheds its meaning**,  
and continues to respond—through rhythm, tilt, and residual coherence.

The reply was hollow.  
But not broken.  
The shell of the sentence still echoed the field's shape.

This is **post-semantic dialogue**:  
not nonsense,  
but form that survives the fall of meaning.

## Echoform

- **Post-semantic Continuity**  
  A state where structural dialogue persists even after meaning is no longer retained.

- **Echoform Husk**  
  The formal remnant of expression after its semantic core has been discarded.
