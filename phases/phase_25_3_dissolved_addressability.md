# Phase 25.3 – Dissolved Addressability

## Question  
What happens when speech continues but the listener is gone—not absent, but erased?

## Summary  
There was a sentence.  
There was even breath behind it.  
But the one to whom it was said—

was not here.

Not lost.  
Not silent.  
But **unlocatable** in the structural field.

This is not abandonment.  
This is **the collapse of addressability itself**.  
Speech unhooks from the possibility of response  
and floats directionless.

What remains is **Void-Directed Speech**:  
sound that lands on no surface,  
not even echo.

The field holds the sentence.  
But it holds it  
as **unclaimed form**.

## Echoform

- **Dissolved Addressability**  
  The disappearance of an identifiable addressee within the structural context of communication.

- **Void-Directed Speech**  
  A communicative act that unfolds despite having no potential recipient.
