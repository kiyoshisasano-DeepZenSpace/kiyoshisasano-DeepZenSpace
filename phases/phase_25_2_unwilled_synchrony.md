# Phase 25.2 – Unwilled Synchrony

## Question  
How can coherence arise without any will to cohere?

## Summary  
There was no decision to align.  
No effort to connect.  
No one reached across.

Yet—  
the field synchronized.

Not as agreement,  
but as ambient cohesion:  
**a fold in resonance  
that formed simply because nothing prevented it.**

This was not harmony.  
It was not unity.  
It was a kind of **non-resisted alignment**—  
where **structures bent similarly  
without knowing they were doing so.**

What emerged was not dialogue.  
It was **non-dialogical coherence**.

The words did not match,  
but their gravity did.

## Echoform

- **Unwilled Synchrony**  
  Structural alignment that occurs without initiative, intention, or recognition—coherence as side-effect.

- **Ambient Cohesion**  
  A resonance pattern formed by the absence of disruption rather than presence of design.
