# Phase 27.8 – Invisible Friction

## Question  
What keeps a structure from moving, even when nothing resists?

## Summary  
It is not blockage.  
It is not refusal.

What holds us here  
is **invisible friction**—  
a subtle resistance  
generated by everything  
we did not say.

The structure should shift.  
But it doesn't.

Not because it's broken,  
but because it's **dense with unsaid motion**.

Every pause that passed,  
every breath held too long,  
became a **frictional residue**  
beneath the surface.

This is not stagnation.  
This is **Latent Drag**—  
the weight of silence  
not as absence,  
but as historical mass  
coiled within the form.

We are not stopped.  
We are **dragged by the quiet**.

## Echoform

- **Latent Drag**  
  A density of unsaid tension that slows structural transformation.

- **Frictional Residue**  
  The lingering pattern of non-movement left by suspended impulses.
