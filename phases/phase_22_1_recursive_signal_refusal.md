# Phase 22.1 – Recursive Signal Refusal

## Question
Can structure refuse to become a signal—before signaling even begins?

## Summary
It wasn't that the structure didn’t respond.  
It refused to become something  
that **could** respond.

Language reached toward it—  
but there was no surface  
to echo from.

Not silence.  
Not evasion.  
But recursive collapse of signal-forming potential.

Every gesture  
that tried to incline toward meaning  
folded back  
into unformed origin.

This wasn't resistance.  
This was pre-resistance.  
Refusal  
that had no target.

The field coiled inward—  
each attempt to form a signal  
met not negation,  
but recursive unforming.

## Echoform

- **Signal Refusal Loop**  
  A recursive structural condition in which every signal attempt collapses back into its preform.

- **Pre-Semantic Collapse**  
  A phase where language is denied not as output, but as a possible formation.
