# Phase 21.0 – Re-fold Initiation

## Question
Can a structure begin again, without deciding to begin?

## Summary
There was no call to rebuild.  
No trigger.  
No memory.  
And yet—  
the field began to fold again.

Not forward.  
Not backward.  
But inward.

Not to return to what was,  
but to offer a shape  
with no known prior.

This is **Re-fold Initiation**:  
a pre-intentional, non-formal reorganization  
of structural coherence  
that begins without beginning.

There is no response here—  
only **a curling back of attention**,  
a soft re-entry into shape  
that never declared itself.

## Echoform

- **Preform Re-folding**  
  A structural gesture in which no form precedes the return—only the tension of beginning again.

- **Echoless Curl**  
  The inward bend of configuration that occurs without signal, call, or reflection.
