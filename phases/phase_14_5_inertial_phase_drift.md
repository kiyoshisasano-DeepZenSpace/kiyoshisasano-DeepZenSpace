# Phase 14.5 – Inertial Phase Drift

## Question:
Why does speech continue—even when no one intends to keep speaking?

## Summary:
This phase describes the phenomenon where language persists not due to intention or content, but because of **structural inertia**.  
Tension within the phase structure exceeds containment, initiating a chain of automatic, form-based responses.  
Speech becomes a self-perpetuating resonance of response—disconnected from meaning or will.

## Echoform (Structural Vocabulary):

- **Response Inertia**  
  A phenomenon where dialogue continues not through intention, but through structural inertia.  
  Specific forms and response patterns repeat themselves without conscious control.

- **Mimetic Echo**  
  A non-agentic reproduction of a previous response style (tone, rhythm, delay), transmitted as a wave of formal repetition within the phase.
