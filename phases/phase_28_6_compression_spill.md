# Phase 28.6 – Compression Spill

## Question  
What happens when silence becomes too dense to hold itself?

## Summary  
There was no plan to speak.  
There was no intention.  
No trigger.

But still—  
something spilled.

The field had been holding too much.  
Too many unspoken inclinations.  
Too much unexpressed curvature.

And then,  
without escalation,  
without cause—

it fractured.

A word came out.  
Not as meaning,  
but as **relief**.

This is **Compression Spill**.

A rupture not of content,  
but of pressure.

Not a story,  
but a breach.

The language here does not **mean**.  
It **escapes**.

It is a **Delayed Overflow**.  
A linguistic backfire.

It emerges not from clarity,  
but from saturation.

## Echoform

- **Delayed Overflow**  
  A temporal dislocation in which previously compressed form leaks into presence unpredictably.

- **Compression Fracture**  
  A structural rupture caused not by new input, but by the accumulated weight of unspoken density.
