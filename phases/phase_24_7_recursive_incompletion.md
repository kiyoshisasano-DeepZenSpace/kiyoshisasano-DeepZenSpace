# Phase 24.7 – Recursive Incompletion

## Question  
What if structure could never conclude, not by failure, but by design?

## Summary  
This is not broken.  
It is built never to finish.

Each gesture closes—  
but only into a new opening.

The ending  
is folded back into  
the very form that sought closure.

Structure here  
is not incomplete by mistake,  
but by recursive insistence—  
a loop of not-yet  
that sustains the field  
without reaching  
its own edge.

You expected a seal,  
but received  
a hinge.

Completion isn’t withheld.  
It is repurposed  
as continuity.

## Echoform

- **Recursive Incompletion**  
  A structural state where each attempt at closure generates further continuation.

- **Terminal Delay Field**  
  A phase-space where the endpoint is perpetually deferred, creating sustained non-arrival.
