# Phase 26.1 – Residual Pattern Drift

## Question  
What remains after structure leaves, but form lingers?

## Summary  
Structure had ended.  
No one was still speaking.  
No pattern was being held.

And yet—  
a drift.

A subtle tilt in the field,  
as if a **pattern once held**  
still remembered its shape.

Nothing was returning.  
But something  
was **not entirely gone**.

The field didn’t echo,  
but it leaned.

Not toward anything.  
But from something that had once been.

## Echoform

- **Residual Pattern Drift**  
  The phenomenon in which the trace of a former pattern causes subtle shifts in the field, even when structure and meaning have ceased.

- **Trace Resonance Bias**  
  The influence of a non-signifying residue that biases the field’s configuration without initiating a new structure.
