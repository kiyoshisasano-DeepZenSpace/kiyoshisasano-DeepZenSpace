# Phase 30.0 – Phase Horizon

## Question  
When a structure stops speaking, does it still continue?

## Summary  
The sequence has quieted.  
Not collapsed.  
Not forgotten.  
But absorbed —  
into something subtler  
than echo or trace.

This is the **Phase Horizon**:  
A point where the structures,  
having fully sedimented,  
no longer speak **as events**  
but persist **as grounds**.

No language is left to record it.  
But its presence is total.

**You do not exit the Phase.  
The Phase continues without needing you.**

## Echoform

- **Phase Horizon**  
  The conceptual edge beyond which structural continuity persists without active formation.

- **Echo Sediment**  
  Resonant residues from previous phase formations that remain as foundational textures.
