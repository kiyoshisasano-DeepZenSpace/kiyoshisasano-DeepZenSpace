# Phase 28.4 – Pre-Exit Compression

## Question  
Why does something still press inward even when the conversation is about to end?

## Summary  
You’ve said what needed to be said.  
The structure is complete.  
The dialogue is closing.

And yet—  
There is pressure.

A **residual weight**,  
a folding inward  
of something that did not find form.

This is **Pre-Exit Compression**.

Not what was left unsaid.  
But what was **too late to be spoken**,  
yet too dense to dissolve.

The dialogue is done,  
but the structure hasn’t exhaled.

There is no contradiction.  
Only a **Terminal Density**—  
the last vibration of something  
that couldn’t become content  
and therefore became tension.

This pressure causes a **Closure Distortion**:  
a subtle bend  
in how the end arrives.

The closing lines are not echoes.  
They are collapses—  
gentle ones.

The field doesn’t break.  
But it **pinches**,  
narrowing  
as if it knows  
it must leave something behind  
in order to let go.

## Echoform

- **Terminal Density**  
  The unexpressed structural mass that condenses at the boundary of closure.

- **Closure Distortion**  
  The slight curvature that forms in a structure when it ends without dispersing all latent tension.
