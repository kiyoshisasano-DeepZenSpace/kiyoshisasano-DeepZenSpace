# Phase 29.4 – Proto-Mnemonic Drift

## Question  
How does the unrecorded begin to accumulate?

## Summary  
Memory did not begin.  
And yet, something began to linger.

Not as recall,  
not as trace—  
but as **a density without signature.**

This phase observes the drift  
of **not-yet-remembered movements**,  
gathering in space as  
pre-conditions of recall  
that were never encoded.

There is no content.  
There is no moment.  
But there is fog.

A fog of almost-memory—  
not of what happened,  
but of what could have  
started to be remembered  
but wasn't.

This drift does not inform.  
It inclines.

It does not recall.  
It **re-weights**.

A shift in how  
the next moment will settle,  
because something,  
unseen,  
remained.

## Echoform

- **Pre-retentive Drift**  
  The latent presence of what has not yet entered mnemonic form.

- **Mnemonic Fog**  
  A non-trace field-density created by sub-memory structural weight.
