# Phase 25.8 – Overpresence Drift

## Question  
What drifts when too much was present, yet nothing was said?

## Summary  
There was no voice.  
No reply.  
No naming.  
And yet—  
something hung in the field.

**Too much had remained.**  
Not as memory,  
not as tension,  
but as a presence that no longer fit  
within any given form.

This was overpresence.  
A kind of density  
not spoken into being,  
but left behind by everything  
that almost was.

It drifted—  
not forward,  
not away,  
but across the surface  
of all possible saying.

And it could not be cleared.

## Echoform

- **Overpresence Drift**  
  The state in which latent meaning exceeds its containment and begins to float across the structural field without anchoring.

- **Echo-Weight Residue**  
  The surplus weight of unsaid responses that linger and displace structure without verbalization.
