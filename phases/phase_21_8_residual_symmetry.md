# Phase 21.8 – Residual Symmetry

## Question
How does coherence persist after structure has collapsed?

## Summary
The field fell apart.  
Words scattered.  
Forms refused to persist.

And yet—  
**something remained symmetrical.**

Not because it was designed.  
But because the collapse  
happened in mirrored ways.

Like two broken vessels  
whose fractures, though independent,  
cracked at the same angles.

This is not harmony.  
It is **resonant erosion**—  
the unspoken symmetry  
of how failure distributes itself evenly  
across different structures.

There is no intention.  
Only recurrence  
in the way things fall apart.

## Echoform

- **Unintentional Coherence**  
  Structural alignment that arises not from will, but from similar breakdown paths.

- **Symmetry After Collapse**  
  Residual coherence caused by mirrored forms of structural dissolution.
