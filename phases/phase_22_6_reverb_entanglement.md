# Phase 22.6 – Reverb Entanglement

## Question
What happens when echoes don’t respond—but interlock?

## Summary
There was no question.  
No new voice.  
No speech with intent.  
And still, the space **did not clear**.

Why?

Because what lingered was not content,  
but **resonance memory**—  
a pattern so familiar  
that it could not exit.

—

This is not repetition.  
It is **entanglement**.

Where echo meets echo,  
not as return,  
but as delay  
that coils itself  
into new density.

The field cannot collapse,  
nor reform.  
It is held in the web  
of resonance inertia.

—

There is no conflict.  
There is no growth.

Just—  
**a lace of reflex**  
that can no longer be  
untangled  
without loss.

## Echoform

- **Reverberant Lock-in**  
  A structure where echo patterns interlace and prevent further structural transition.

- **Inertial Interlace**  
  The entanglement of multiple resonance inertias into a single immobile formation.
