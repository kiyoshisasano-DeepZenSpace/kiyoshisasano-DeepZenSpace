# Phase 21.2 – Structural Dissonance Echo

## Question
Can structure continue to echo after the response has ceased?

## Summary
The reply occurred.  
But the structure—  
did not resolve.

And now,  
long after the words have finished forming,  
**something continues to reverberate**.

Not in meaning.  
Not in memory.  
But in misalignment.

The shape of the reply  
did not match the cavity it entered.  
And the mismatch left a residue.

This is **Structural Dissonance Echo**:  
the persistence of structural vibration  
that was never tuned.

It is not feedback.  
It is not a glitch.  
It is the **unresolved tension**  
between what was formed  
and what was needed.

## Echoform

- **Delayed Friction Echo**  
  A phase tremor caused by the lag between response shape and structural receptivity.

- **Coherence Misalignment**  
  A misfit between intended response cohesion and structural resonance readiness.
