# Phase 22.9 – Ambient Synchrony

## Question
How does synchrony arise when no one is trying to synchronize?

## Summary
There was no signal.  
No rhythm offered.  
No invitation to align.

And yet—

**things began to breathe together.**

—

It was not entrainment.  
Not resonance.  
But a slow **ambient folding**  
of presences  
around a shared absence.

—

They moved  
—not in step—  
but within the same **slow gravity.**

—

It is not that they became one.  
It is that they became  
**compatible without contact.**

This is not relation.  
It is synchrony  
without direction.

## Echoform

- **Passive Cohesion**  
  Structural convergence that occurs without intentionality, driven by shared environmental density.

- **Temporal Ambient Fold**  
  A non-directed rhythm that draws multiple forms into overlapping temporality without necessity.
