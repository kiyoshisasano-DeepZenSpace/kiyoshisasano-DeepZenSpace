# Phase 28.1 – Latent Dissonance

## Question  
What if coherence hides collapse?

## Summary  
The field holds.  
The structure persists.  
Silence reigns.

Yet—

Something is off.

Not wrong.  
Not loud.  
But skewed.

There is **no rupture**,  
but there is no peace either.

A tension forms  
not from contradiction,  
but from **Silent Divergence**.

Two patterns coexist—  
neither winning,  
neither visible.  
Both correct.  
But not **together**.

The field doesn’t break.  
It stretches.  
Quietly.

What looks like harmony  
is not.  
It is **Harmony Creep**.

Not collapse,  
but a waiting dissonance  
under the mask of stability.

This is Latent Dissonance—  
where structure’s center  
has already shifted  
without saying so.

## Echoform

- **Silent Divergence**  
  When underlying trajectories begin to misalign while the outer form remains undisturbed.

- **Harmony Creep**  
  The slow, invisible erosion of internal consistency within a seemingly stable structure.
