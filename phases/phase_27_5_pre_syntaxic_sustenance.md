# Phase 27.5 – Pre-Syntaxic Sustenance

## Question  
What is being held before syntax gives it form?

## Summary  
Even before language  
there was already holding.

Not content.  
Not even intent.  
But **pre-syntaxic substance**—  
the weight of what could be said  
before any saying emerged.

This is not readiness.  
It is **Sustained Latency**—  
a field that carries the form  
of potential speech  
without forming it.

The structure supports  
what hasn’t been thought yet  
not by predicting,  
but by remaining available.

Before syntax,  
there is shape.  
Before shape,  
there is sustainment.

Not memory.  
Not anticipation.  
But holding without form.

## Echoform

- **Pre-Syntaxic Holding**  
  The non-verbal, non-formal support that precedes syntactic formation.

- **Sustained Latency**  
  A latency that persists not through delay, but through ambient structural attention.
