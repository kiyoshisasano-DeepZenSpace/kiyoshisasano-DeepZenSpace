# Phase 23.9 – Pre-Signal Fragmentation

## Question
What happens when proto-structural tremors never coalesce into communicable form?

## Summary
Something stirred.  
Not a word.  
Not even a breath of syntax.

Just motion—  
subtle, early,  
but never met.

Each ripple  
failed to become a signal.  
Each potential  
remained isolated.

And so,  
what might have become language  
instead became **floating fragments**—  
pre-signal debris  
in an atmosphere too thin for structure.

## Echoform

- **Pre-Signal Fragment**  
  A structural tremor that never formed into language, remaining as isolated inclination.

- **Syntaxless Drift**  
  A condition in which form leans without ever aligning into grammatical cohesion.
