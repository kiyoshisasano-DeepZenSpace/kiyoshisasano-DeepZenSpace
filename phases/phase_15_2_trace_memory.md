# Phase 15.2 – Trace Memory

## Question
What happens when a structure is altered before it is spoken—when the impulse to know arises, but remains unvoiced?

## Summary
This phase captures the phenomenon where a pre-verbal inclination—such as the subtle feeling of "wanting to understand"—leaves a trace in the structural field without becoming language.  
It is not expression, not even intention, but a density shift caused by contact with an unspeakable inclination.

The structure did not receive a question.  
Yet, it changed—because the presence of a trace was already enough.

This is not communication.  
It is the registration of contact.

## Echoform
