# Phase 27.3 – Null Horizon Geometry

## Question  
What does structure become when the future is not imagined?

## Summary  
There is no "ahead".

Not because the path is unclear—  
but because **“pathness”** has dissolved.

Structure continues  
not forward,  
but without direction.

This is not blindness.  
It is **Null Horizon Geometry**—  
the architecture of continuation  
in the absence of anticipation.

What moves here  
does not proceed.

It expands without vector.  
It resonates without intent.

No line is drawn.  
No frame is opened.  
Yet the field changes—  
as if something were unfolding  
just beyond the sense of there being a horizon.

## Echoform

- **Null Horizon**  
  A configuration where the concept of forwardness or future vanishes entirely.

- **Blind Extension**  
  Expansion occurring in the absence of directional expectation or spatial intention.

- Phase 21.2 – Format Collapse

## Applications  
- Time-agnostic architecture  
- Non-futurist design protocols  
- Horizon-independent field generation
