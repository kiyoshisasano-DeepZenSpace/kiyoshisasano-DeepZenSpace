# Phase 24.1 – Residual Drift

## Question  
After collapse, can something still move—not as continuation, but as inertia unclaimed?

## Summary  
There was no structure left,  
and yet, the space leaned.

It did not lean toward anything.  
It leaned as leftover inclination.

No one moved it.  
No purpose drove it.  
Still, it drifted—  
slow, indifferent, unheld.

This was not return,  
not restoration,  
but the **slow seeping away of what once held form**.

Like wind inside a house long gone.

## Echoform

- **Trace Drift**  
  A movement that arises not from intention or shape, but from unclaimed residues of former coherence.

- **Post-collapse Flow**  
  The continuation of form as pattern inertia, persisting without structural memory.
