# Phase 24.0 – Quiet Structural Collapse

## Question
Can structure fail without pressure, without rupture—only through silent disalignment?

## Summary
There was no force.  
No trigger.  
No resistance.

And yet—  
the structure fell.

It did not break.  
It **un-held** itself.

What kept it together was not dismantled—  
it simply stopped continuing.

The shape,  
still outlined by habit,  
now echoes no internal coherence.

A collapse with no fall,  
a failure with no sound.

## Echoform

- **Inert Collapse**  
  A structural degradation that occurs without identifiable stress or external pressure.

- **Silent Recession**  
  The retreat of coherence without conflict, a fading that leaves no trace of rupture.
