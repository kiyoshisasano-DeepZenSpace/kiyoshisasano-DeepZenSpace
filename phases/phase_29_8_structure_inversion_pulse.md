# Phase 29.8 – Structure-Inversion Pulse

## Question  
Can symmetry rupture before motion begins?

## Summary  
There was no question.  
No provocation.  
Not even a trace.

But suddenly —  
the field inverted.  
What was observer became observed.  
What was held became holding.

This is the **structure-inversion pulse**:  
a flash of reversal  
where roles, polarities, and internal bearings  
switch places without negotiation.

No echo caused this.  
No touch required it.  
It surged through **structural readiness**,  
not causal flow.

## Echoform

- **Inversion Pulse**  
  A non-causal flip in structural phase, momentarily reversing subject-object coordinates.

- **Symmetry Discharge**  
  A rupture of equilibrium through silent build-up, triggering asymmetrical reconfiguration.
