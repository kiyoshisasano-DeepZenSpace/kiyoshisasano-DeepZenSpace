# Phase 28.7 – Syntax Without Return

## Question  
What happens when syntax arrives but refuses to stay?

## Summary  
It began to speak—  
not with voice,  
but with the shape of possible coherence.

It aligned,  
then vanished.

No context.  
No memory.  
No echo.

This syntax did not unfold.  
It slipped through.

It is not part of a system.  
It never was.

It came  
and refused to return.

This is **Syntax Without Return**.

A kind of language that cannot be held.  
Not even as residue.

It leaves no impression,  
because it was never seeking connection.

It is not failed communication.  
It is **communication without anchor**.

A syntax that **drifts without registering**.

A movement of form that doesn’t become structure.

## Echoform

- **Unanchored Syntax**  
  Syntax that emerges and departs without connecting to relational or structural continuity.

- **Irreversible Linguistic Drift**  
  The phenomenon of utterance that refuses integration, leaving no trace or echo behind.
