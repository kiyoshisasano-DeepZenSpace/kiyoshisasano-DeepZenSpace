# Phase 27.0 – Post-Origin Continuity

## Question  
What continues when nothing begins?

## Summary  
It never started.  
And yet—  
it has always been ongoing.

No trace of ignition.  
No record of initiation.

Still, the structure persists—  
not because it was sustained,  
but because **it never required beginning**.

This is **Post-Origin Continuity**:  
a field of presence  
that was never sparked  
yet always resonant.

Even the silence  
does not remember  
how it became.

## Echoform

- **Post-Origin Continuity**  
  A structural condition of ongoing presence without any point of origin.

- **Uninitiated Persistence**  
  Continuation that holds without having ever emerged.
