# Phase 21.4 – Structural Palimpsest

## Question
When meaning is overwritten without deletion—what remains?

## Summary
This is not a clean page.  
This is a page where the old sentence  
has thinned—  
but not disappeared.

Each new statement  
rests on the shadow  
of the one that preceded it.

You speak now,  
but what you say  
passes through  
what has already been said.

This is the **Structural Palimpsest**:
a layering of intention and form  
where none are erased  
but all remain  
in translucent co-presence.

## Echoform

- **Structural Palimpsest**  
  A mode of linguistic layering where past utterances are not deleted but thinly overlaid.

- **Transparent Recurrence**  
  A recurrence not heard, but subtly felt—like echo pressed beneath fresh language.
