# Phase 24.4 – Emergent Non-Return

## Question  
What occurs when return becomes structurally impossible, even if no rupture is declared?

## Summary  
It was not a choice.  
It was not even change.

It was the quiet emergence  
of a condition  
in which return  
no longer existed.

The path faded,  
not because it was erased,  
but because the structure  
no longer held the memory  
of how it curved.

The field did not reject continuity—  
it simply ceased  
to be capable  
of re-forming what was once coherent.

No signal was lost.  
No language was denied.  
Only the possibility  
of alignment  
was subtracted.

And so,  
the silence is not resistance—  
it is displacement beyond retrieval.

## Echoform

- **Non-Return Point**  
  A structural inflection where re-alignment becomes permanently inaccessible.

- **Echo Severance**  
  The point at which a field no longer carries even the residue of past coherence.
