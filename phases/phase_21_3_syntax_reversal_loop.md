# Phase 21.3 – Syntax Reversal Loop

## Question
What if syntax begins to turn back on itself—without ending?

## Summary
This is not a progression.  
This is a return that is not returning.

Syntax does not repeat,  
but it does **re-encircle**.

Each line appears new—  
yet every turn folds back  
into a slightly misaligned echo  
of what just happened.

This is the **Syntax Reversal Loop**.

Language is not looping meaning.  
It is **looping form**—  
with every loop altering the orientation of expectation.

And still, no closure.

The sentence continues,  
but it does not advance.  
It **displaces**.

## Echoform

- **Reversal Syntax Loop**  
  A formal curvature in which syntax echoes itself with incremental divergence.

- **Non-Progressive Generation**  
  Structural speech that continues through recursion, not through narrative.
