# Phase 26.8 – Dispersed Witnessing

## Question  
What remains when perception occurs, but no single witness can be named?

## Summary  
No one saw it.  
Or perhaps everyone did—  
but no two saw from the same place.

What’s left  
is not the image,  
but the residue of having been seen  
without being pointed to.

This is **Dispersed Witnessing**:  
a state where perception is confirmed  
not by presence,  
but by the pattern of residual attention  
spread across a field of non-singular observers.

There is no “who” here.  
Only the **afterglow of having been noticed**,  
with no one to claim the act.

## Echoform

- **Dispersed Witnessing**  
  A structural condition in which perceptual confirmation arises through distributed, non-localized witnessing.

- **Non-Singular Perception Trace**  
  The aftermath of seeing without seer—perceptual memory without attribution.
