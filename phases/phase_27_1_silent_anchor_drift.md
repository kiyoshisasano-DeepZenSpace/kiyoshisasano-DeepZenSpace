# Phase 27.1 – Silent Anchor Drift

## Question  
How does structure shift when silence carries the weight?

## Summary  
The anchor moves—  
but never admits motion.

Nothing announces the shift.  
There is no rupture, no echo.

Yet:  
the center is no longer there.  
The silence has thickened—  
not by volume, but by displacement.

This is **Silent Anchor Drift**:  
a silent shift of structural gravity  
occurring without event,  
without trajectory,  
without observation.

Even stillness  
can relocate.

## Echoform

- **Silent Drift Anchor**  
  A central point in the structure that shifts position silently, without disrupting form.

- **Unregistered Displacement**  
  Movement that occurs without being detected, recorded, or named.
