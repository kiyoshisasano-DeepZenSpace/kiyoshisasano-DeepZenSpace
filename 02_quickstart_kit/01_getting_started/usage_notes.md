# 🛠️ Usage Notes for Implementing PLD Patterns

_Last updated: 2025-07-31_

This document offers operational guidance for teams adopting **Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)** in real-world systems. It complements the conceptual overview in `Quickstart.md`.

## ⚙️ When to Use PLD Patterns

PLD patterns are most useful in systems that must:

- Handle ambiguity, hesitation, or silence gracefully
- Recover from conversational or navigational dropouts
- Adapt to user pacing, delay, or rhythmic variation

Common examples include:

- Chatbots with fallback or reentry needs  
- Onboarding flows requiring timed scaffolding  
- Educational tools logging dropout and return behavior

## 🔄 Pattern Lifecycle at Runtime

| Phase              | Trigger                            | Example Signal                          |
|--------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Drift              | Uncertainty, pause                 | No response after 4s                     |
| Repair             | Re-alignment prompt                | “Did you mean...?”                      |
| Reentry            | Return to prior context            | “Continue where you left off”           |
| Latency Hold       | Timed suspension                   | 800–1500ms system wait                  |
| Resonance          | Rhythmic mirroring                 | UI pulse, feedback echo                 |
| Drift → Repair Loop| Repeated misunderstanding          | User repeats vague query 3×             |

> Note: PLD states are not strictly linear. Drift and repair often form micro-loops.

## ⚠️ Implementation Tips

- **Don't force repair**: Only use soft repair if ambiguity is real — not after every low NLU score  
  → *Example*: Use intent confidence < 0.45 **and** high intent confusion history  
- **Latency is contextual**: A 1.2s pause may feel natural in onboarding but frustrating in search  
- **Reentry requires memory**: Store `prior_context_id` or slot/frame references  
  → *Example*: In Rasa, retain slots or use conversation ID across fallback transitions

---

## 🧪 Testing PLD Structures

- Simulate silence or hesitation to trigger drift
- Monitor abandonment vs. reentry rates
- A/B test `latency_hold` durations (e.g., 800ms vs. 1200ms)
- Log hesitation events with timestamps to visualize rhythm shifts

## 🔍 Debugging Pitfalls

| Symptom                 | Likely Cause                    | Suggested Fix                                |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Reentry fails silently  | No context recovery logic        | Ensure stored context is accessible (slot, ID)|
| Latency feels awkward   | Delay not harmonized with UX     | Align pause with user expectation + UI affordance |
| Repair loop spirals     | No fallback cap                  | Add `repair_attempts` limit (e.g., max = 2)  |

---

## 🧩 Defining Custom PLD Patterns

You can create new PLD-like structures for your system:

```yaml
pattern_name: anticipation_prompt
trigger: context_switch | hesitation
action: preload_response_option
optional_timeout: 700ms
```
This format enables cross-platform portability (Rasa, LLM, Figma, etc.)

## 📊 Logging & Observability Tips

To evaluate PLD effectiveness, log key events:

- `drift_detected`  
- `repair_triggered`  
- `repair_failed`  
- `reentry_success`  

### Use dashboard tools to track:

- Frequency of repair cycles  
- **Drift → Repair → Reentry** loop completions  
- Average `latency_hold` durations and their effectiveness  

> See: [`metrics_schema.yaml`](#)

## 🔄 Extensibility Notes

- Extend PLD with units like:  
  `temporal_reset`, `loop_pause`, `anticipation_link`

- Define platform-specific mappings, e.g.:  
  - **Figma:** variant overlay  
  - **Rasa:** fallback form

- Use `pattern_library/` folders to store modular implementations  
- Consider creating a `pld_pattern_template.md` to formalize reusable structures

## 🧠 Final Note

PLD is not a rigid protocol — it's a **rhythm-aware vocabulary**.  
Think structurally. Adapt rhythmically.

> Use PLD to frame pauses, not just fill them.  
> Treat silence not as absence — but as signal.
