# ⚡ Quickstart – Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD) with Mathematical References

**Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)** is a modular interaction model that treats **drift**, **repair**, and **reentry** as **designable, reusable structures** — not system failures.  
It supports building adaptive, resilient, and rhythm-aware UX across AI tools, learning flows, and dialogue systems.

This quickstart is for **UX designers, AI engineers, and prototypers** who want to implement PLD patterns **with grounding in the formal model**.

## ▶️ 01. What Is PLD?

PLD models interaction not as a straight line, but as a **looping rhythm** — full of pauses, clarifications, and returns.

> “Drift is not deviation — it’s rhythm under construction.”

**Core idea:**  
When users pause, hesitate, or go off-script…  
Don’t treat it as error — treat it as **structure**.

| Term           | Meaning                                                  | Math Ref |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| **Drift**      | Delay, ambiguity, or off-path behavior                   | 𝒟(σ,t) — eq. (1.3) |
| **Repair**     | Clarification or re-alignment maneuver                   | ℛ(σ) — eq. (1.5) |
| **Reentry**    | Return to a dropped or interrupted flow                  | Loop reinit — sec. 3.3 |
| **Latency Hold** | Intentional pause to simulate rhythm or give space     | 𝓛₃ latency operator — sec. 3.2 |
| **Resonance**  | Echo or pacing match that affirms timing or intent       | σ* fixed point — Theorem 2 |

## ▶️ 03. Sample Loop Pattern (Logic + Math Link)

### 🔁 Drift → Repair → Reentry

```yaml
- state: drift_probe
  trigger:
    silence_timeout: 5s       # Drift trigger (𝒟 > threshold)
    low_NLU_confidence: <0.45
  action: latency_hold(delay=900ms)  # Latency operator 𝓛₃

- state: soft_repair
  prompt: "Just to confirm — did you mean [X] or something else?"
  transition:
    user_confirms: reentry_link
    user_denies: repair_escalation

- state: reentry_link
  resume_from: prior_context_id

- state: repair_escalation
  action: handoff_or_reset_prompt
```

**Math grounding:**  
- Drift detection threshold → eq. (1.3) coherence gradient condition  
- Repair step → eq. (1.5) kernel integration  
- Reentry link → Loop closure property (Theorem 5)

## ▶️ 06. Safety & Loop Handling (Math-Based)

PLD emphasizes **recovery without infinite fallback cycles**.

Mathematical constraints for safety:
- **Repair Closure** — ℛ(Σ) ⊆ Σ (Axiom 2) → All repair outputs remain valid states  
- **Loop Compositionality** — Prevents uncontrolled loop growth (Axiom 3)  
- **Stability Conditions** — Use Lyapunov-based checks (Theorem 3) to avoid divergence

Implementation checklist:
- ✅ Max repair attempts (configurable)  
- ✅ Detect unresolved drift (𝒟 remains above threshold)  
- ✅ Persist context IDs for reentry  
- ✅ Log unresolved loops (`drift_unrecovered`) for dashboard tracking
