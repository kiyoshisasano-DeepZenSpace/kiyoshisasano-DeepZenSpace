## 📌 PLD (Phase Loop Dynamics) – Core Interaction Model Summary with Mathematical & Theoretical References

**Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)** is a structural framework for modeling **resilient, rhythm-aware interaction** — particularly in UX flows where users hesitate, pause, or deviate.  
It reframes traditional errors (e.g., confusion, latency, dropout) as **modular design primitives** grounded in formal loop theory.

### 🔁 Core PLD Primitives (with Math References)

| Term            | Description                                                                 | Math Ref |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| **Drift**       | Moment of ambiguity, silence, latency, or user hesitation                   | 𝒟(σ,t) – eq. (1.3) |
| **Repair**      | Lightweight recovery step (clarification prompt, retry path, soft fallback) | ℛ(σ) – eq. (1.5) |
| **Reentry**     | Flow resumption after dropout or loop break                                 | Loop re-init – sec. 3.3 |
| **Latency Hold**| Intentional delay or rhythmic pause to simulate pacing or give space        | 𝓛₃ – sec. 3.2 |
| **Resonance**   | Rhythm-matching cue (e.g., feedback echo, UI tempo alignment)               | σ* fixed point – Theorem 2 |

### 🔄 Canonical PLD Sequence

**Mathematical Form:**  
Drift (𝒟 > θ) → Repair (ℛ) → Reentry → (optional) Latency Hold (𝓛₃) → Resonance (σ*)

**Process View:**  
1. **Drift** – Pause or off-track behavior triggers detection (gradient of C(σ,t), eq. 1.4).  
2. **Repair** – System offers non-blocking support (ℛ, eq. 1.5).  
3. **Reentry** – Prior state is restored; closure ensured by Axiom 2 (Repair Closure).  
4. **Resonance** – If alignment is reached, system enters rhythm match (Theorem 2).

### 🎯 Why It Matters

These primitives allow systems to adapt **without treating deviations as outright failures**, leading to:

- **Robustness** – Continuous flow despite drift events  
- **Trust-awareness** – Gentle recovery fosters user confidence  
- **Human pacing** – Aligns with conversational and cognitive rhythms  

In design terms, each primitive (e.g., `soft_repair`, `latency_hold`) is both:

- A **UX interaction unit**  
- A **state transition** in dialogue or process flows  
- A **recoverable phase** in the phase space Σ (sec. 1.2)

   - Dialogue: Rasa `FallbackAction` + slot retention  
   - UI: Figma overlay delays  
   - LLM: Context-aware reentry prompts  
2. **Measurement**  
   - Metrics: drift→repair ratio, reentry success rate  
   - Schema: `metrics_schema.yaml` + `pld_event.schema.json`  
3. **Theory Integration**  
   - Loop stability via Lyapunov criteria (Theorem 3)  
   - Resonance convergence (Theorem 2)
