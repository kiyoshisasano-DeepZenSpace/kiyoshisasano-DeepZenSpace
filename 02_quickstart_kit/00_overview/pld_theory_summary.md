## 📌 PLD (Phase Loop Dynamics) – Core Interaction Model Summary

**Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)** is a structural framework for modeling **resilient, rhythm-aware interaction** — especially in UX flows where users hesitate, pause, or deviate.  
It reframes traditional errors (e.g., confusion, latency, dropout) as **modular design patterns** rather than failures.

### 🔁 Core PLD Primitives

| Term            | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Drift**       | Moment of ambiguity, silence, latency, or user hesitation                   |
| **Repair**      | Lightweight recovery step (clarification prompt, retry path, soft fallback) |
| **Reentry**     | Flow resumption after dropout or loop break                                 |
| **Latency Hold**| Intentional delay or rhythmic pause to simulate pacing or give space        |
| **Resonance**   | Optional rhythm-matching cue (e.g., feedback echo, UI tempo alignment)      |

### 🔄 Basic PLD Sequence

→ **Drift** *(pause or off-track)*  
→ **Repair** *(non-blocking support offered)*  
→ **Reentry** *(system restores prior flow or partial state)*  
→ *(optional)* **Resonance** *(if feedback is repeated or mirrored)*

### 🎯 Why It Matters

These concepts help systems **adapt when users deviate** — making flows more:

- Robust  
- Trust-aware  
- Human-paced  

Each unit (e.g., `soft_repair`, `latency_hold`) can be expressed as:

- A **UX interaction primitive**  
- A **fallback pattern** in dialogue systems  
- A **recoverable state** in learning or form flows
