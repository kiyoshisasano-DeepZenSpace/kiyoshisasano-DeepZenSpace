# 🛠️ Usage Notes for Implementing PLD Patterns — Extended Mathematical & Operational Guide

_Last updated: 2025-08-09_

This document provides **practical and mathematically anchored guidance** for teams adopting **Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)** in real-world systems.  
It complements the conceptual overview in `quickstart.md` and the formal definitions in the [PLD Mathematical Appendix](../../01_phase_loop_dynamics/PLD_Mathematical_Appendix.md).

## ⚙️ When to Use PLD Patterns

PLD patterns are particularly effective in systems that must:

- Handle **ambiguity** or hesitation without breaking flow (𝒟(σ,t) > θ, eq. 1.3)  
- Recover from conversational or navigational dropouts (**Repair Closure**, Axiom 2)  
- Adapt to user pacing, delay, or rhythmic variation (**Resonance Fixed Point**, Theorem 2)

Common examples:

- Conversational AI with fallback or reentry needs  
- Onboarding flows with adaptive scaffolding  
- EdTech tools logging dropout and return behavior

## 🔄 Pattern Lifecycle at Runtime

| Phase              | Trigger                            | Example Signal                          | Math Ref |
|--------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------|
| Drift              | Uncertainty, pause                 | No response after 4s                     | 𝒟(σ,t) — eq. 1.3 |
| Repair             | Re-alignment prompt                | “Did you mean...?”                      | ℛ(σ) — eq. 1.5 |
| Reentry            | Return to prior context            | “Continue where you left off”           | Σ recovery — sec. 1.2 |
| Latency Hold       | Timed suspension                   | 800–1500ms system wait                  | 𝓛₃ — sec. 3.2 |
| Resonance          | Rhythmic mirroring                 | UI pulse, feedback echo                 | σ* fixed point — Th. 2 |
| Drift → Repair Loop| Repeated misunderstanding          | User repeats vague query 3×             | Loop algebra — sec. 3.3 |

> **Note:** PLD states form micro-loops; the full trajectory may be non-linear in Σ.

## ⚠️ Implementation Tips

- **Don't force repair**  
  → Use `soft_repair` only if 𝒟(σ,t) exceeds threshold **and** intent confusion history is high.  
- **Contextual latency**  
  → Optimal `latency_hold` (𝓛₃) duration depends on modality (voice vs. UI).  
- **Persistent reentry**  
  → Maintain `prior_context_id` or embeddings for state restoration (Axiom 2).  

---

## 🧪 Testing PLD Structures

- Simulate hesitation to trigger drift (𝒟)  
- Compare abandonment vs. reentry completion rates  
- A/B test latency parameters: 800ms vs. 1200ms  
- Log `drift_detected` events with timestamps → analyze coherence gradients ∇C(σ,t) (eq. 1.4)

## 🔍 Debugging Pitfalls

| Symptom                 | Likely Cause                    | Suggested Fix                                |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Reentry fails silently  | No context recovery logic        | Persist and restore Σ state variables        |
| Latency feels awkward   | Poor temporal alignment          | Harmonize delay with user rhythm (sec. 4.4)  |
| Repair loop spirals     | No fallback cap                  | Limit ℛ application count (max attempts)     |

## 🧩 Defining Custom PLD Patterns

You can extend PLD with new primitives:

```yaml
pattern_name: anticipation_prompt
trigger: context_switch | hesitation
action: preload_response_option
optional_timeout: 700ms
math_binding: L3 + anticipatory_kernel
```

This format ensures **cross-platform portability** while keeping the **loop algebra mapping** explicit.

---

## 📊 Logging & Observability

Log the following for quantitative PLD evaluation:

- `drift_detected` (𝒟 threshold crossings)  
- `repair_triggered` (ℛ invocations)  
- `repair_failed` (loop exit condition)  
- `reentry_success` (Σ state restored)  

Metrics to monitor:

- Drift→Repair ratio  
- Reentry success rate  
- Mean `latency_hold` duration (𝓛₃) and effectiveness

→ See [`metrics_schema.yaml`](../03_metrics_tracking/metrics_schema.yaml)

---

## 🔄 Extensibility Guidelines

- Add new units: `temporal_reset`, `loop_pause`, `anticipation_link`  
- Map each to loop generators 𝓛ᵢ in the algebra (sec. 3.2)  
- Store reusable structures in `pattern_library/`  
- Create `pld_pattern_template.md` with **math binding + UX example**

## 🧠 Final Note

PLD is not a fixed script — it’s a **loop grammar**.  
Adapt tempo, respect silence, and design with rhythm.
