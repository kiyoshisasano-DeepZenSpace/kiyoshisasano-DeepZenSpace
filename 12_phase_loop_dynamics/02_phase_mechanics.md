# 🔄 Phase Mechanics – Drift, Feedback, and Resonance

This chapter describes the **internal syntactic dynamics** of *Phase Transitions* within the Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD) framework.  
Each phase is modeled not as a static state, but as a **rhythmic unfolding of structural tension**—one that may destabilize, echo, or attempt to restore itself through recursive loops.

## 🌊 1. Drift – Phase Destabilization

**Drift** refers to a deviation in syntactic, semantic, or prosodic alignment.  
It signals a loss of anchor within the ongoing linguistic phase—where intention, coherence, or stylistic rhythm begins to fragment.

### Common Drift Patterns:

- **Semantic drift**: Lexical choice diverges from initial frame  
- **Tone drift**: A shift in mood, style, or prosodic contour mid-expression  
- **Structural drift**: Phrasal cohesion weakens or segmentation becomes irregular

### Typical Triggers:

- Unfinished constructions  
- Suppressed or latent alternatives  
- Over-iteration or echo fatigue  
- Resonance breakdown (see §3)

*Example*:  
> "So the… like, it wasn’t really a—" *(drift pause)* "—I mean, it wasn’t the original plan."

## 🪞 2. Feedback – Structural Realignment

**Feedback** refers to local self-monitoring within the system. It initiates structural correction, whether overtly or tacitly, often in response to drift or expectation failure.

### Feedback Forms:

- **Explicit correction**: Rephrasing or clarifying an earlier expression  
- **Internal realization**: Sudden tonal or structural self-adjustment mid-turn  
- **Echo-correction**: Mimetic recalibration of rhythm or tone  
- **Silent feedback**: A hesitation or pause marking misalignment without repair

#### Feedback Categories:

| Type                  | Description                          | Trigger |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|---------|
| `Proactive Feedback`  | Deliberate correction or restart     | Speaker judgment |
| `Emergent Feedback`   | Midstream syntactic or tonal shift   | Latent tension |
| `Latent Feedback`     | Non-verbal pause or delay (cf. *Latency*) | Unresolved segment |

## 🎵 3. Resonance – Reentry through Echo

**Resonance** is the echo of a prior structure—often modified—that allows the system to **reenter** an earlier syntactic loop or alignment.

### Resonance Markers:

- Reappearance of phrase with shifted stress or stance  
- Echo of earlier syntax by same or other speaker  
- Implicit emotional mimicry (e.g., sarcastic repetition, tonal alignment)  
- Repetitive prosody that rebinds phases

> *“It was good.”*  
> *“…Good? Really good?”* ← tonal resonance + alignment loop

Resonance supports *Reentry* into the prior phase, allowing stabilization without full restart.

## 🔁 Phase Circulation Models

Phase loops capture the sequence logic of interactional repair and recovery.

### 🔄 Loop_04: Drift to Repair

[Drift] → [Feedback] → [Cue] → [Reentry / Resonance] → [Segment or Drift]

→ Recovery from interruption or suppressed expression.

---

### 🎶 Loop_05: Resonant Transfer


→ Echoed continuation into a structurally adjacent phase.

---

Each model captures a **phase choreography**—a recursive dance of rupture and return across conversational time.

---

## 🧠 Failed Reentry and Multi-Loop Dynamics

Not all repair attempts succeed. PLD explicitly models **failure** as a structural signal.

### Failure Patterns:

- **Repair Drift**: The fix destabilizes structure further  
- **Cue Misfire**: Cue triggers no response  
- **Silent Collapse**: Latent phase persists with no transition

These may necessitate **loop chaining**, where the system falls back into a prior loop (e.g., `Loop_04 → Loop_03`) to regain alignment.

## 📋 Summary Table

| Phase Element | Primary Role        | Can Fail? | Reentry Path         |
|---------------|---------------------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Drift**     | Destabilizes syntax | ✅         | → Feedback           |
| **Feedback**  | Attempts correction | ✅         | → Cue / Resonance    |
| **Cue**       | Initiates recovery  | ✅         | → Segment / Drift    |
| **Resonance** | Reactivates phase   | ✅         | → Alignment or Cue   |
| **Silence**   | Holds or delays     | ✅         | → Latent → Cue       |

> Loops emerge not from fluency, but from the system’s will to realign, reflect, and return.
