*Phase Loop Dynamics: A Syntax-Centered Model of Structural Drift, Alignment, and Resonance*

---

## 🔹 Overview

**Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)** is a framework for modeling conversational syntax as a system of **recursive phase transitions**, driven by feedback, drift, and resonance.  
Unlike linear models, PLD treats interactional syntax as a **topographic structure** — one shaped by shifts, loops, and latent realignments across dialogic time.

The model accounts for interactional phenomena such as:

- Abandoned or fragmented constructions  
- Hesitation, self-repair, and mid-turn revision  
- Syntactic mimicry and phase reentry  
- Silence, latency, and structural disjunction  
- Response chaining and dynamic alignment

These are unified under a **loop-based account of emergent syntax in use**, where linguistic form is continually shaped by internal and external feedback.

## 🔹 Motivation

Existing theories in syntax, pragmatics, and dialog modeling have addressed:

- Turn-taking structure (Sacks et al., 1974)  
- Repair initiation and coordination (Schegloff et al., 1977)  
- Structural priming (Bock & Griffin, 2000)  
- Alignment and adaptation in dialog (Pickering & Garrod, 2004)  
- Ellipsis and syntactic deletion (Chomsky, 1981)

Yet these often treat interactional mechanisms in isolation from the **syntactic space in which they evolve**.

PLD offers an integrative model that supports:

- Fine-grained conversational annotation  
- Design of adaptive interactional agents  
- Visualization of syntax through interface topography  
- Cross-linguistic modeling of feedback structures

Whether as annotation schema or theoretical lens, PLD connects syntax to recursive interactional form.

## 🔹 Key Concepts

| Term                | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Phase               | A dynamic syntactic state or transition unit in interaction. |
| Loop                | A recursive cycle triggered by repair, mimicry, or misalignment. |
| Drift               | Gradual disalignment in syntax, meaning, or rhythm. |
| Resonance           | Repetition or echoing that restores or reinforces structure. |
| Latency             | Temporarily delayed or unspoken syntactic action. |
| Cue-driven Repair   | Repair processes initiated via silence, feedback, or internal monitoring. |

These terms are defined in [`glossary/`](../12_phase_loop_dynamics/glossary_academic_mapping_v2.md), and mapped to formal linguistic frameworks.

## 🔹 Research Foundation

Phase Loop Dynamics draws from:

- **Generative Syntax** — hierarchical phase logic (Chomsky, Rizzi, Cinque)  
- **Conversation Analysis** — sequential structure and repair (Sacks, Schegloff, Jefferson)  
- **Cognitive Linguistics** — framing, alignment, and conceptual blending (Fauconnier, Langacker)  
- **Pragmatic Interfaces** — user-centered linguistic coordination (Clark, Winograd)  
- **Dialog Systems & Feedback Models** — alignment engines and discourse repair (Du Bois, Pickering & Garrod)

Each tradition informs how PLD handles structural instability, syntactic emergence, and phase-bound recurrence.
