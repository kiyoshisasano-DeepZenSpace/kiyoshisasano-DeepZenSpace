*Phase Loop Dynamics: A Syntax-Centered Model of Structural Drift, Alignment, and Resonance*

---

## 1. Overview

**Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)** models conversational syntax as a system of **recursive phase transitions** driven by feedback, drift, and resonance.  
Unlike linear approaches, PLD treats interactional syntax as a **topographic structure**, shaped by shifts, loops, and latent realignments over dialogic time.

PLD accounts for phenomena such as:

- Abandoned or fragmented constructions  
- Hesitation, self-repair, and mid-turn revision  
- Syntactic mimicry and phase reentry  
- Silence, latency, and structural disjunction  
- Response chaining and dynamic alignment

These are unified under a **loop-based account of emergent syntax in use**, where linguistic form is continuously shaped by internal and external feedback.

---

## 2. Motivation

Traditional theories in syntax, pragmatics, and dialogue modeling have addressed:

- Turn-taking structure (Sacks et al., 1974)  
- Repair initiation and coordination (Schegloff et al., 1977)  
- Structural priming (Bock & Griffin, 2000)  
- Alignment and adaptation in dialogue (Pickering & Garrod, 2004)  
- Ellipsis and syntactic deletion (Chomsky, 1981)

However, these often treat interactional mechanisms in isolation from the **syntactic space in which they unfold**.

PLD offers an integrative framework that supports:

- Fine-grained conversational annotation  
- Design of adaptive interactional agents  
- Visualization of syntax through interface topography  
- Cross-linguistic modeling of feedback structures

## 3. Key Concepts

| Term *(Lexicon Tier)* | Description | Stability |
|-----------------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Phase** (`@core`) | Dynamic syntactic state or transition unit in interaction. | 🟢 |
| **Loop** (`@core`) | Recursive cycle triggered by repair, mimicry, or misalignment. | 🟢 |
| **Drift** (`@core`) | Gradual disalignment in syntax, meaning, or rhythm; use with scope qualifiers. | 🔴 |
| **Resonance** (`@derived`) | Repetition or echo reinforcing prior structure. | 🔴 |
| **Latency** (`@derived`) | Temporarily delayed or unspoken syntactic action. | 🔴 |
| **Cue-driven Repair** (`@support`) | Repair triggered by silence, feedback, or internal monitoring. | 🟡 |

## 4. Research Foundations

PLD draws on insights from:

- **Generative Syntax** — hierarchical phase logic (Chomsky, Rizzi, Cinque)  
- **Conversation Analysis** — sequential structure and repair (Sacks, Schegloff, Jefferson)  
- **Cognitive Linguistics** — framing, alignment, conceptual blending (Fauconnier, Langacker)  
- **Pragmatic Interfaces** — user-centered linguistic coordination (Clark, Winograd)  
- **Dialogue Systems & Feedback Models** — alignment engines and discourse repair (Du Bois, Pickering & Garrod)
