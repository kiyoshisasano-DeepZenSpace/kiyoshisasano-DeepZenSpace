# 📘 Phase Loop Dynamics  
*A Syntax-Centered Framework for Drift, Resonance, and Recursive Repair*

---

## 🔹 About This Repository

This repository introduces **Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)** — a structural framework for modeling interactive syntax through recursive phase topologies.  
It models conversational phenomena and latent feedback structures, including:

- Observable drift and repair across utterances
- Syntactic mimicry and resonance in dialogue
- Latent alignment cues and structural echoes
- Feedback-triggered reformulation and phase reentry

PLD bridges linguistic theory, discourse analysis, human-computer interaction (HCI), and conversational AI.
