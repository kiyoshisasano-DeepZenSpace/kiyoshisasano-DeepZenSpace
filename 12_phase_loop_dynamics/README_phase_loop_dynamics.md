*A Syntax-Centered Framework for Drift, Resonance, and Recursive Repair*

---

## 🔹 Overview

**Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)** is a framework for modeling syntactic behavior in dialogue and text generation as **loop structures**.

The framework describes and analyzes phenomena such as:

- **Drift** — divergence of meaning or structure during discourse
- **Resonance** — reactivation of syntactic or intonational patterns
- **Latent Phase** — silent yet structurally active pre-expression state
- **Cue-Driven Repair Loops** — structural restarts and corrections

PLD bridges linguistics, discourse analysis, human–computer interaction (HCI), and conversational AI.
