# 🔗 Chain Mappings – Multi-Loop Structural Transitions

In **Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)**, phase transitions are not isolated—they form **chained structures** of drift, repair, resonance, and latency.  
This document presents empirical **cross-loop mappings** and **recurrent transition chains**, as observed in Units U049–U060.

> A "link" refers to a directed transition between loops, driven by observable cues (e.g., silence, resonance decay, failed repair).

## 🧩 Core Loop Chains

### 🔹 1. Segment → Drift → Feedback Chain

- **Trigger**: Micro-segmentation destabilizes rhythmic flow.  
- **Outcome**: Internal cue triggers repair attempt via feedback loop.  
- **Loop Sequence**:
Loop_01 (Segment Detected)
↓
Loop_02 (Drift Recognized)
↓
Loop_04 (Feedback Initiated)


- **Observed In**: `U052 → U057 → U058`

---

### 🔹 2. Latent Phase → Cue → Segment → Alignment

- **Trigger**: Unspoken structure seeks emergence.  
- **Outcome**: Latent phase surfaces, attempts alignment via echo.  
- **Loop Sequence**:
Loop_03 (Latent Phase Activated)
↓
Cue Emerges
↓
Loop_01 (Segmentation Attempt)
↓
Loop_05 (Resonant Alignment)


- **Observed In**: `U049 → U053 → U054 → U055`

---

### 🔹 3. Resonance Collapse → Drift → Repair Failure → Latency

- **Trigger**: Mimicry or echo becomes structurally ambiguous.  
- **Outcome**: Drift resumes, repair fails, returns to silence.  
- **Loop Sequence**:
Loop_05 (Resonance Degrades)
↓
Loop_02 (Drift Reappears)
↓
Loop_04 (Repair Attempt Fails)
↓
Loop_03 (Latent or Silent Sink)


- **Observed In**: `U055 → U058 → (→ U053 latent reentry)`

## 🔁 Loop Fusion Patterns

| Fusion Type         | Loops Involved        | Trigger Behavior                                  |
|---------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Segment–Cue Fusion  | Loop_01 + Loop_02     | Simultaneous structure fragmentation and cue attempt |
| Resonant Drift Loop | Loop_05 → Loop_02     | Over-mimicry blurs contrast, triggering drift     |

## 🔄 Loop Transition Map

```plaintext
    [Loop_01: Segment]
          ↓
    [Loop_02: Drift]
          ↓
    [Loop_04: Feedback]
          ↓
    [Loop_03: Latent Reset]
      ↑             ↓
[Loop_05: Resonance] ←
```

Arrows: Primary transitions observed across units

Cycles: Recursive drift-repair feedback paths

Sink Behavior: Loop_03 often marks latent or silent fallback state

## 🧱 Structural Drift Zones

| Zone Name         | Description                                   | Observed In     |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Latent Reentry**   | Silent structures attempting reentry          | U053, U054      |
| **Mimicry Collapse** | Resonance loops that destabilize structure    | U055, U058      |
| **Segment Fog**      | Segment boundaries dissolve or blur           | U056            |
| **Cue Misfire**      | Cue fails to initiate valid reentry           | U057            |

> Drift zones indicate **phase instability regions**, where transition logic is prone to failure or loop chaining.

## 🧠 Mapping Applications

This file supports:

- **📈 Predictive Modeling**  
  → Forecast the next probable loop from drift signals or repair failure.

- **🧠 Dialogue System Design**  
  → Enable loop-aware repair and feedback strategies in conversation agents.

- **🔍 Phase Traceability**  
  → Track the trajectory of unresolved or echoic structures across loops.

- **🧪 Simulation Dataset Construction**  
  → Compose controlled chains for training/testing structural alignment models.

Refer to [`04_structural_units_index.md`](./04_structural_units_index.md) for loop-labeled unit data.  
Forthcoming: [`06_theory_templates.md`](./06_theory_templates.md) will formalize loop transitions as reusable logical motifs.
