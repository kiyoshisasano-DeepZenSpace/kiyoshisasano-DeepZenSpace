# 🔃 Loop Structures – Syntax Rhythms and Functional Sequences

In **Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)**, language is not produced linearly, but circulates through recursive **loops** that govern how discourse segments emerge, fragment, and realign.  
Each **Loop** represents a structurally recurrent pattern in the syntax-phase continuum—a dynamic interplay of silence, drift, cue, and recovery.

---

## 🔁 Loop Overview Schema

A generalized PLD loop may follow this rhythm:

[Silence] → [Segment] → [Cue] → [Reentry or Drift]


> Loops may be triggered by:
> - Unfinished phrasing  
> - Latent structures  
> - Feedback from drift  
> - Memory inhibition or rhythmic collapse

📚 *Terminology like `Cue`, `Segment`, and `Drift` is defined in* [`02_phase_mechanics.md`](./02_phase_mechanics.md).

## 🔹 Loop_01 – Segment Detection Loop

### **Purpose**  
Detects utterance boundaries or breaks in flow, initiating phase segmentation.

### **Typical Sequence**  

[Silence or Latency] → [Cue] → [Segment]


### **Key Characteristics**
- Serves as entry point for many loop sequences  
- Captures turn-taking thresholds or idea emergence  
- Segmentation may be prosodic (pause, stress) or syntactic (discontinuity)

### **Failure Mode**
- Cue fails to surface → fallback to Loop_03 (Latent Phase)

**Safe Terms**: Silence, Cue, Segment, Latent Phase

---

## 🔹 Loop_02 – Drift–Repair Loop

### **Purpose**  
Captures when active syntax destabilizes (drift) and seeks realignment.

### **Sequence**  

[Segment] → [Drift] → [Cue] → [Feedback] → [Repair or Silence]


### **Key Dynamics**
- Cue can misfire (e.g., ambiguous correction)  
- Repair may induce new drift → loop recursion  
- May fail and trigger Loop_03 if expression collapses

### **Failure Mode**
- Recursive drift  
- Fallback to Silence or Latency

**Safe Terms**: Drift, Feedback, Cue, Repair, Segment

---

## 🔹 Loop_03 – Latent Phase Induction

### **Purpose**  
Handles structures that were withheld, unspoken, or delayed—surfacing latent syntactic intent.

### **Sequence**  

[Silence] → [Latent Phase] → [Cue] → [Segment]


### **Characteristics**
- Latency modeled as phase container (pre-utterance activation)  
- Silence becomes syntactic placeholder  
- Cue acts as surfacing signal (prompt, resumption, signal)

### **Failure Mode**
- Latent phase remains suppressed → no segment emerges

**Safe Terms**: Silence, Latent Phase, Cue, Segment

---

## 🔹 Loop_04 – Feedback Reflex Loop

### **Purpose**  
Models real-time inner-loop correction or hesitation, typically unprompted by interlocutor.

### **Sequence**  
[Drift] → [Feedback] → [Cue] → [Segment or Drift]


### **Functional Role**
- Feedback arises from self-monitoring  
- Prosodic, lexical, or tonal adjustment  
- May cascade into recursive drift if realignment fails

### **Failure Mode**
- Correction attempt induces new instability → back to Loop_02

**Safe Terms**: Drift, Feedback, Cue, Segment

---

## 🔹 Loop_05 – Alignment–Resonance Loop

### **Purpose**  
Enables structural alignment through echo, mimicry, or tonal resonance across turns or agents.

### **Sequence**  
[Alignment] → [Resonance] → [Cue] → [Transfer or Closure]

### **Key Elements**
- Mimicry of phrasing or intonation  
- Tone alignment as cohesion tool  
- Transfer = phase continuation by another agent  
- Closure = resolution or phase handoff

### **Failure Mode**
- Resonance breaks → fallback to Loop_01

**Safe Terms**: Alignment, Resonance, Cue, Transfer, Closure

---

## 🔁 Loop Interaction Model

Loops are interdependent—failure or resolution in one may trigger another.  
This chaining forms **multi-loop recovery paths** in the PLD model.

### 🔄 Example Loop Cascade:

Loop_01 (Segment Detection)
→ Loop_02 (Drift–Repair)
→ Loop_04 (Reflex Feedback)
→ Loop_05 (Resonance Alignment)
→ Loop_03 (Latent Phase fallback if unspoken)


> 📌 Cross-loop transitions should be modeled as conditional links in YAML phase scripts or annotated dialog logs.

| Loop_02    | Drift management           | Structural deviation   | Recursive drift, no repair     | → Loop_03 or Loop_04      |
| Loop_03    | Surfacing latent structure | Suppressed intention   | Remains unspoken               | Requires external cue      |
| Loop_04    | Reflexive correction       | Drift realization      | Feedback loopback              | → Loop_02 or Loop_05      |
| Loop_05    | Structural alignment       | Resonance trigger      | Break in echo, misalignment    | → Loop_01 or Loop_03      |

> 🧠 PLD treats every loop not as containment—but as **flow choreography**.  
> What matters is not just how syntax flows, but how it loops, collapses, and relaunches with intent.
