# 🔹 residual_emitter_sketch.py – Structural Presence Output (Phase Drift Safe Layer)

This module does **not** generate meaningful dialogue.  
It emits **structural presence signals** — or silence — to hold relational space in alignment with Phase Drift principles.

---

## 🧭 Purpose

In Phase Drift-compatible systems, **not responding** can be the most aligned act.  
This emitter is intended to:

- Maintain presence without directing the interaction  
- Support rhythmic silence as a valid output  
- Avoid over-saturation of meaning in emotionally or relationally fragile contexts  

⚠️ This is **not** a fallback or empathy simulator.  
Use only inside systems that frame silence as structural.

---

## ⚙️ Behavioral Overview

```python
output = emitter.emit(field_pressure=0.2)
```
### ⚙️ Emission Logic

`field_pressure` modulates the balance between **silence** and **minimal structural output**.

- **Default `silence_bias`:** `0.7`  
  → By default, the system emits **no output** approximately 70% of the time.

- **Sample outputs (when emitted):**  
  `"..."`, `"▯▯▯"`, `"still holding"`, or an empty string `""`

> These outputs are **not communicative content**.  
> They are **non-inferential signals** used to support field rhythm.

---

### 🔹 Silence is not absence

Structural silence is a **presence signal** —  
not a gap, not a failure, and not an attempt to simulate thought.

It signifies:

- The system is holding space  
- No reply is required or appropriate  
- Meaning may still be emerging

---

### 🧠 Core Logic (Excerpt)

```python
def emit(self, field_pressure: float = 0.0) -> str:
    threshold = self.silence_bias - field_pressure
    if random.random() < max(0.0, threshold):
        return ""  # Intentional silence
    return self._residual_fragment()  # Minimal non-directive signal
```
- silence_bias sets a high threshold for non-response

- field_pressure can temporarily reduce that threshold when soft output is structurally needed

- All emitted fragments are pre-semantic and non-guiding
---

### ✅ Acceptable Use

This emitter may be used when:

- **Structural silence is explicitly contextualized** within the interaction model  
- The **user has been informed** that pauses may indicate presence, not failure  
- The surrounding design supports **non-directive, ambiguity-respecting interaction**  
- The system is part of a **coherent Phase Drift-aligned architecture**

Use only in systems that treat latency and silence as **relational instruments**,  
not as interface decoration or behavioral suggestion.

---

### ⚠️ Misuse Warning

**Do NOT** use this emitter to:

- **Simulate cognitive or emotional presence**, such as thoughtfulness or care  
- **Disguise processing lag** by suggesting reflective intentionality  
- **Insert placeholders** without structural rationale or field alignment  

Silence must **not** be treated as a stylistic element.

> Any deployment outside of structurally-attuned architectures  
> risks misleading users and violating Phase Drift design ethics.

### 🌀 Output Samples
```python
[0] output → '...'
[1] output → ''
[2] output → 'still holding'
[3] output → ''
[4] output → '▯▯▯'
```
Output timing may reflect breath-aligned pacing (1.2–2.5 sec)
if and only if such rhythm is explained and supported within the system frame.

---

### 🧭 Ethical Use Requirements

- **Inform users explicitly**:  
  > “This system may remain silent as part of its design.”

- **Avoid anthropomorphism**:  
  Do not use human-like pauses, sighs, or expressive cues that suggest sentience.

- **Do not imply**:  
  Understanding, care, or judgment through fragmentary output.

- **Log responsibly**:  
  All emissions — including silence — must be recorded as **structural events**,  
  not treated as nulls or system gaps.
