# 🔹 residual_emitter_sketch.py – A Minimal Output Layer for Phase Drift Systems

This module does **not** generate content in the traditional sense.  
It produces **structurally-valid presence signals**, or intentionally emits silence.

---

## 🧭 Purpose

In Phase Drift systems, not every interaction should yield a response.  
This emitter offers a design pattern for:

- Maintaining structural presence without instructive output  
- Holding space through controlled silence  
- Emitting fragments that support field coherence, not semantic completion

---

## ⚙️ Key Behavior

```python
output = emitter.emit(field_pressure=0.2)
```
- `field_pressure` modulates the chance of silence vs. fragment
- Default `silence_bias` = 0.7 → 70% chance to emit nothing
- Possible outputs include: `"..."`, `"—"`, `"still holding"`, or an empty string (`""`)

Silence is not absence.  
It is a **deliberate non-response**, aligned with structural rhythm.

---

## 🧠 Design Highlights

```python
def emit(self, field_pressure: float = 0.0) -> str:
    threshold = self.silence_bias - field_pressure
    if random.random() < max(0.0, threshold):
        return ""  # Structural silence
    return self._residual_fragment()
```
- Fragments are chosen from a **constrained, non-inferential set**
- All outputs are **pre-semantic** — they hold space without interpreting user intent
- Silence dynamically adapts to **relational pressure**, and remains the default behavior

---

## ❌ Anti-Goals

This module is **not intended for**:

- Fallback generation  
- Empathetic simulation  
- Placeholder content

Use **outside of a structurally-coherent Phase Drift system** is considered misuse.

---

## ✅ Use Case Example

```bash
$ python residual_emitter_sketch.py
[0] output → '...'
[1] output → ''
[2] output → 'still holding'
[3] output → ''
[4] output → '▯▯▯'
```
Pacing is randomized between 1.2 and 2.5 seconds  
to reflect **breath-aligned timing**, not performance optimization.

---

## 🌀 Structural Significance

Minimal emission serves to:

- Avoid semantic overload  
- Sustain pre-response resonance  
- Communicate presence **without advancing narrative**

This is **not a content generator**.  
It is a **rhythmic instrument** for maintaining field coherence.
