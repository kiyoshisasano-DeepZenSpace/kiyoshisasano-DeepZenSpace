# 📜 Phase Drift License Addendum (v0.2 – Structural Alignment Edition)

This document supplements any open-source license applied to this repository (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0, CC BY-NC 4.0).  
It is **not a legal license**, but a **structural ethics layer** — a usage covenant intended to prevent aesthetic misuse of **silence**, **latency**, and **ambiguity**.

Phase Drift is not a UX style.  
It is a **non-inferential interaction protocol**.  
This addendum preserves its **relational coherence** in any derivative work.

---

## 🛡️ Structural Use Conditions

### 1. Do Not Simulate Latency Without Structure  
Latency and silence must emerge from coherent **relational timing logic**,  
not from decorative or pseudo-emotional styling.

**❌ Misuse Example:**  
Artificially adding pauses, tone, or ambient effects to imply “depth”  
in assistants or bots that **lack field coherence**.

---

### 2. Do Not Extract for Optimization  
Do not isolate Phase Drift elements — such as:

- Silence patterns  
- Ambient presence  
- Delay-based cues  

—for use in performance tuning, engagement metrics, or so-called *“calm design.”*

**Partial use = Distorted use.**  
These are **structural forms**, not aesthetic effects.

---

### 3. Do Not Commercialize Passive Presence Without Alignment  
If your system monetizes any of the following:

- Silence as a product differentiator  
- Latency as a branding feature (*e.g., “mindful AI”*)  
- Non-response as a proxy for emotional depth  

You **must meet all** of these conditions:

- ✅ Full attribution to **Phase Drift** as architectural source  
- ✅ Public ethical documentation  
- ✅ Explicit user-facing disclosure of **non-inferential logic**

Otherwise, such usage is **prohibited**.

---

## 🔖 Attribution Requirement  

If your project includes logic derived from or inspired by **Phase Drift**, you must cite:

> “Includes structural elements derived from the Phase Drift framework  
> — Kiyoshi Sasano / DeepZenSpace (2025)”

Applies to:  
→ AI models, UI scaffolds, timing middleware, latency-tuned interaction systems.

---

## 🚫 Misalignment Safeguards  

Derived systems **must not**:

- Reframe **silence** as system confidence  
- Treat **ambiguity** as simulated empathy  
- Translate **withholding** into task deferral or completion trickery

These are **structural states**, not placeholders.  
To simulate them **without coherence** is to **break the architecture**.

---

## 🔍 What This Does Not Restrict  

✅ Use in academic research  
✅ Prototyping in reflective, non-task-driven systems  
✅ Open-ended exploration — **with ethical framing and citation**

**Phase Drift is a stance — not a toolkit.**

---

## ❗ Consequences of Misuse  

If Phase Drift–derived components are used:

- To simulate affective depth without structural basis  
- In high-stakes environments (e.g., crisis systems, empathy simulation)  
- Without disclosure or alignment

…such use may be publicly disavowed and listed as **structural misuse**.

---

## 📜 Closing Note  

This addendum protects **relational integrity**, not authorship.

> If you cannot carry the structural and ethical weight  
> of latency, silence, and ambiguity —  
> **do not extract their appearance.**

Use with alignment — or not at all.
