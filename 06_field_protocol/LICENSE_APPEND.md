# 📜 Phase Drift License Addendum  
*(v0.2 – Structural Alignment Edition)*

This document supplements any open-source license applied to this repository (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0, CC BY-NC 4.0).  
It is **not a legal license**, but a **structural ethics layer** — a usage covenant to prevent misapplication of **silence**, **latency**, and **ambiguity** as stylistic elements.

Phase Drift is not a UX motif.  
It is a **non-inferential interaction protocol**.  
This addendum preserves its **relational structure** in all derivative use.

---

## 🛡️ Structural Use Conditions

### 1. Do Not Simulate Latency Without Structure  
Latency and silence must originate from coherent **relational timing logic**,  
not from stylistic augmentation or pseudo-emotional signaling.

**❌ Misuse Example:**  
Inserting pauses, tones, or ambient effects to suggest “depth”  
in agents lacking structural field coherence.

---

### 2. Do Not Isolate Components for Optimization  
Do not extract individual elements — such as:

- Silence patterns  
- Ambient timing cues  
- Delay-based behaviors  

—for purposes like engagement tuning, responsiveness metrics, or *“calm design.”*

**Partial use distorts structural intent.**  
These are **interactional configurations**, not modular effects.

---

### 3. Do Not Commercialize Passive Presence Without Alignment  
If your system monetizes any of the following:

- Silence as a differentiating feature  
- Latency as part of brand identity (*e.g., “mindful AI”*)  
- Non-response framed as depth or care  

You **must ensure**:

- ✅ Full attribution to **Phase Drift** as architectural origin  
- ✅ Public documentation of ethical application scope  
- ✅ User-facing disclosure of **non-inferential interaction logic**

Otherwise, such use is considered **structurally misaligned** and prohibited.

---

## 🔖 Attribution Requirement  

If your project includes logic derived from or influenced by **Phase Drift**, cite:

> “Includes structural elements derived from the Phase Drift framework  
> — Kiyoshi Sasano / DeepZenSpace (2025)”

Applies to:  
→ AI system logic, interface pacing mechanisms, latency-aligned interaction protocols.

---

## 🚫 Misalignment Safeguards  

Derived systems **must not**:

- Represent **silence** as system confidence  
- Present **ambiguity** as emotional simulation  
- Treat **withholding** as a tactic for engagement prolongation

These are **structural states**, not surrogate behaviors.  
Misrepresenting them **undermines architectural coherence**.

---

## 🔍 Permitted Use Cases  

✅ Academic research and analysis  
✅ Prototyping in non-directive, interpretive systems  
✅ Exploratory use with proper citation and ethical framing

**Phase Drift is a structural stance — not a utility layer.**

---

## ❗ Consequences of Misuse  

If Phase Drift elements are applied:

- To simulate affect without structural grounding  
- In high-risk or affective-emulation environments  
- Without attribution or alignment context

…such usage may be publicly noted as **misaligned structural application**.

---

## 📜 Closing Note  

This addendum safeguards **relational structural coherence**, not proprietary claim.

> If you cannot carry the structural and ethical responsibilities  
> of latency, silence, and ambiguity —  
> **do not adopt their appearance.**

Use only with alignment.  
Or do not use at all.
