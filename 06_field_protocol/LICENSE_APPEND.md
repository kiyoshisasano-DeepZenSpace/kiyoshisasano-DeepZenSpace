# üìú Phase Drift License Addendum (v0.2)

This document supplements any open-source license (MIT, Apache 2.0, CC BY-NC) applied to this repository.

It is **not a legal license**.  
It is a **structural and ethical guideline** for responsible use of Phase Drift‚Äìinspired components.

Its purpose is to prevent the misuse of latency, ambiguity, and silence  
as surface-level effects **detached from relational structure**.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Structural Use Conditions

If you adapt, reference, or derive from this repository, you agree to the following:

---

### 1. Do Not Simulate Latency Without Structure

Silence, delay, and hesitation must be tied to **relational timing logic** ‚Äî  
not used decoratively or stylistically.

> ‚úò Misuse example:  
> Adding arbitrary pauses or ambient sounds to simulate "depth"  
> in chatbots or assistants without coherence logic.

---

### 2. Do Not Repackage Elements for Optimization

Do not extract specific features (e.g., silence handling, fragmentary output, ambient pacing)  
to optimize task performance, engagement, or "calm UX".

Phase Drift components only function within **full structural integration**.  
Partial usage distorts meaning and risks user misinterpretation.

---

### 3. Do Not Monetize Passive Presence Without Full Attribution

You may **not** commercialize systems that leverage:

- Latency as product differentiator  
- Ambient silence as UX polish  
- Non-directive presence as affective simulation

**Unless all of the following are met:**

- Phase Drift is cited as the structural source  
- Ethical boundaries are publicly documented  
- Users are informed of the system‚Äôs non-inferential nature

---

### 4. Required Attribution

If your system or research includes latency, silence, or withholding logic  
inspired by this repository, you must cite:

> "Includes structural elements derived from the Phase Drift framework  
> (Kiyoshi Sasano / DeepZenSpace)."

Applies to any derivative UI pattern, latency system, or non-directive AI logic.

---

### 5. Do Not Translate Ambiguity Into Closure

Derived systems must not reframe:

- Silence as affirmation  
- Ambiguity as system confidence  
- Withholding as task completion

These are not placeholders ‚Äî they are **active structural states**.  
Premature output violates relational integrity.

---

## üîç Clarification

This addendum **does not restrict**:

- Reproduction for academic research (with attribution)  
- Non-commercial experimentation  
- Exploratory UI in non-task-driven contexts

It **does require** treating Phase Drift as a design stance ‚Äî  
not a stylistic aesthetic or branding layer.

---

## ‚ùó Final Note

If you cannot carry the **structural and ethical weight** of latency, silence, and non-response,  
**do not extract their appearance**.

Use with alignment ‚Äî or not at all.
