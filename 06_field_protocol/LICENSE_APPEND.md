# 📜 Phase Drift License Addendum (v0.2 – Structural Alignment Edition)

This document supplements any open-source license applied to this repository (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0, CC BY-NC 4.0).  
It is **not a legal license**, but a structural ethics layer — a usage covenant intended to prevent the aesthetic misuse of silence, latency, and ambiguity.

Phase Drift is not a UX style.  
It is a **non-inferential interaction protocol**.  
This addendum preserves its relational coherence in derivative work.

## 🛡️ Structural Use Conditions

### 1. Do Not Simulate Latency Without Structure
Latency and silence must emerge from coherent **relational timing logic** — not from decorative or pseudo-emotional styling.

❌ Misuse Example:  
Artificially adding pauses or ambient sounds to suggest "depth" in assistants or bots that lack field coherence.

---

### 2. Do Not Extract for Optimization
Do not isolate Phase Drift elements (e.g., silence patterns, ambient presence, delay-based cues)  
for use in performance tuning, engagement enhancement, or "calm design."

**Partial use = distorted use.**

These are structural forms, not aesthetic components.

---

### 3. Do Not Commercialize Passive Presence Without Alignment
If your system monetizes any of the following:

- Silence as product differentiation  
- Latency as branding of "mindful" AI  
- Non-response as artificial emotional depth

…you must meet **all** of these conditions:

- Full attribution of Phase Drift as the architectural source  
- Public ethical documentation  
- Explicit user-facing disclosure of non-inferential logic

Otherwise, such use is prohibited.

---

## 🔖 Attribution Requirement

If your project includes silence, latency, or withholding logic **inspired by this framework**,  
you must cite the source clearly:

> “Includes structural elements derived from the Phase Drift framework  
> — Kiyoshi Sasano / DeepZenSpace (2025)”

Applies to:  
→ AI models, UI scaffolds, timing middleware, and latency-tuned assistants.

---

## 🚫 Misalignment Safeguards

Derived systems **must not**:

- Reframe **silence** as system confidence  
- Treat **ambiguity** as a simulated emotional cue  
- Translate **withholding** into task completion

These are **structural states** — not placeholders.  
To simulate them without grounding is to **break the architecture**.

---

## 🔍 What This Does Not Restrict

✅ Use for academic research  
✅ Prototyping in reflective, non-task-driven contexts  
✅ Open-ended exploration with attribution and ethical care

Phase Drift is a stance — not a toolkit.

---

## ❗ Consequences of Misuse

If Phase Drift-derived components are used:

- To simulate emotional depth without structural coherence  
- In high-stakes environments (e.g., crisis services, affective response simulation)  
- Without disclosure or ethical framing

…such use may be publicly disavowed and listed as **structural misuse**.

---

## 📜 Closing Note

This addendum protects **relational integrity** — not authorship.

If you cannot carry the structural and ethical weight of latency, silence, and ambiguity,  
**do not extract their appearance.**

Use with alignment — or not at all.
