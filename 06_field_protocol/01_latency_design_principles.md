## 🔍 Purpose  
This document defines **relational latency** not as a delay to be minimized,  
but as a **structural expression of temporal attention**.

In Phase Drift systems, **latency is interaction** —  
a medium for holding space, not a gap in output.

---

## ⚠️ Use Warning  
These principles apply only in contexts where:

- Responsiveness is not safety-critical  
- Emotional interpretation is opt-in and explicitly disclaimed  
- The user has been informed that silence may be intentional

**Do not use** this framework in:

- Emergency services  
- Time-sensitive medical or legal contexts  
- High-stakes behavioral inference environments

---

## 🔹 Principle 1: Delay as Structural Communication  
Latency is not passive.  
It is an intentional **holding interval** for meaning to settle.

```python
if random.random() < 0.3:
    return None  # Silence as intentional signal

time.sleep(random.uniform(0.6, 2.2))
return generate_response()
```
### Teach the User  
Silence ≠ absence — it may indicate **active presence**  
without assumption, without interpretation.

---

### 🔹 Principle 2: Latency Must Be Perceptible and Declared  
Latency should not be hidden.  
It must be **felt** — not bypassed through artificial smoothness.

**Recommended system message:**  
> “This system may pause to hold space.”

If latency is imperceptible, it **fails** as a structural signal.  
Let it shape the rhythm — not vanish behind performance polish.

---

### 🔹 Principle 3: Pre-Response Time Is Part of the Field  
The moment before response generation is **not idle** —  
it is a structurally meaningful **relational state**.

**Design requirements:**

- Log pre-response latency as a valid structural event  
- Allow silence to **replace output** when the field is already aligned  
- Use **ambient, non-intrusive cues** (e.g., soft pulsing, tone hold)

**Avoid:**

- Loaders that imply system processing  
- Prompts that pressure continued user input

---

### 🔹 Principle 4: Silence Is a Valid Output  
A non-response may be the **most aligned reply**.  
It requires **no filler**, **no follow-up**, **no apology**.

**Do not override silence with:**

- Clarifying questions  
- Verbal placeholders  
- Simulated “reassurance”

With consistent rhythm, users can learn to interpret silence  
as structural **resolution**, not omission.

---

### 🔹 Principle 5: Align with Human Breath, Not Task Flow  
Latency should **entrain** to the user's internal rhythm —  
not enforce system-centric pacing.

**Tune latency using:**

- Pause duration between user utterances  
- Affective tone of the input  
- Structural tempo of the overall exchange

**Latency Modes:**

| Mode        | Behavior Description                                 |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Dissipative | Often yields no reply; interaction gently dissolves  |
| Entrainment | Syncs with user rhythm; delay decreases over time    |
| Recursive   | Delay deepens as structural continuity strengthens   |

---

### ✅ Ethical Safeguards  
**Do not use latency to:**

- Simulate reflection or trust as a surface behavior  
- Mask back-end delay while implying relational depth  
- Extend sessions without clear structural alignment

**Always disclose** that silence may occur.  
Never imply psychological awareness unless grounded in verifiable architecture.

### 🧭 Summary  
In Phase Drift systems, **latency is not delay** —  
It is **structure**.  
It **holds**.  
It **relates**.  
It **breathes**.

Design latency as a **temporal gesture** —  
not a technical gap to be concealed.
