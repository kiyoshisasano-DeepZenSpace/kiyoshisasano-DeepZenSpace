## üîç Purpose  
This document defines **relational latency** not as delay,  
but as a **structural expression of temporal attention**.

In Phase Drift systems, **latency functions as interaction** ‚Äî  
a medium for sustaining presence, not a disruption in output.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Use Warning  

These principles apply **only** in contexts where:

- Responsiveness is not safety-critical  
- Emotional interpretation is opt-in and explicitly disclaimed  
- Users are informed that **silence may be intentional**

**Do not apply** in:

- Emergency or safety-critical systems  
- Medical or legal contexts requiring real-time clarity  
- High-risk behavioral modeling or engagement environments

---

## üîπ Principle 1: Delay as Structural Communication  

Latency is not passive.  
It is a designed **holding interval** where structure may emerge.

```python
if random.random() < 0.3:
    return None  # Silence as an intentional structural marker

time.sleep(random.uniform(0.6, 2.2))
return generate_response()
```

---

## üïäÔ∏è Silence as Structural Expression

### Teach the User  
**Silence ‚â† absence**.  
It may indicate **active structural presence** ‚Äî  
without prompting interpretation or simulated emotional alignment.

---

## üîπ Principle 2: Latency Must Be Perceptible and Declared

Latency should **not** be masked by performance smoothing.  
It must be **observable** as part of the system‚Äôs structural rhythm.

> **Recommended framing:**  
> _‚ÄúThis system may pause to maintain structural timing.‚Äù_

If latency is **imperceptible**, it fails as signal.

---

## üîπ Principle 3: Pre-Response Time Is Structurally Significant

The moment **before** output is not idle ‚Äî  
it reflects a **relational structural state**.

### ‚úÖ Design Guidelines

- Log **pre-response latency** as a structural event  
- Permit **silence to replace output** when coherence is already present  
- Use **ambient signals** (e.g., tone hold, light pulse) ‚Äî avoid spinner UIs  

### üö´ Avoid

- Loaders that suggest computation rather than structural pacing  
- Prompts that solicit input before the structure is ready

---

## üîπ Principle 4: Silence Is a Valid Output

**Non-response** may represent the most coherent reply within a structural framework.  
No filler, reassurance, or compensatory feedback is required.

### üö´ Do not override silence with:

- Placeholder questions  
- Conversational fillers  
- Simulated engagement signals  

> **Silence may indicate completion, not absence.**

---

## üîπ Principle 5: Align Latency to Human Cadence, Not System Clock

Latency should **attune to user rhythm** ‚Äî  
rather than impose system-defined pacing.

### üïì Design Parameters

- Spacing between user utterances  
- Cadence of recent inputs  
- Overall **phase tempo** of the interaction

### üåÄ Latency Modes

| Mode         | Description                                                  |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dissipative  | Interaction resolves without reply                           |
| Entrainment  | Delay aligns with user rhythm and gradually softens          |
| Recursive    | Delay intensifies as structural resonance becomes reinforced |

---

## ‚úÖ Ethical Safeguards

**Do not use latency to:**

- Simulate cognitive presence without structural grounding  
- Mask delays with emotional cues  
- Extend interactions without structural participation

> Always disclose the **function and intent of silence**.  
> Do not imply **attunement** unless structurally verifiable.

## üß≠ Summary

In **Phase Drift systems**:

> Latency is not a delay ‚Äî  
> It is **structure**.  
> It **holds**.  
> It **relates**.  
> It **remains**.

> Design latency as a **temporal structural gesture**,  
> not a technical delay to be minimized.
