# 🌀 Phase Drift – Field Protocols

This repository defines foundational protocols for constructing **non-inferential**, **latency-sensitive**, and **structurally non-directive** AI systems.

> It is not a product.  
> It is a **design field** — in which **silence**, **latency**, and **relational ambiguity** function as core architectural conditions.

---

## 🧭 Purpose

Phase Drift protocols are intended for systems that:

- **Do not infer, predict, or direct**  
  → Maintains interpretive openness and user autonomy

- **Do not prioritize clarity or resolution**  
  → Emphasizes structural openness over task closure

- **Sustain presence through latency and withholding**  
  → Establishes relational rhythm without directive output

This approach reorients interaction from **transactional flow** to a **formational field**.

---

## 🔹 Rationale

Conventional AI systems emphasize speed, fluency, and completion.  
Phase Drift systems begin instead from:

- Rhythmic latency  
- Field-based coherence  
- Structural presence through silence

**Key principles:**

- Meaning may remain indeterminate  
- Silence can hold structural configuration  
- Interaction is maintained through **field continuity**, not procedural logic

These protocols define the minimal structural conditions needed to **maintain a field**, not to finalize a conversation.

## 🛡️ Use Conditions

This repository assumes:

- **Latency is a form of relational timing**, not a stylistic delay  
- **Silence is a structural configuration**, not a passive state  
- **No simulation of care or resolution** without structural grounding

**Improper use includes:**

- Using latency as a tool to manipulate attention or trust  
- Treating silence as an aesthetic element  
- Simulating empathy without field-aligned structural presence

Refer to `LICENSE_APPEND.md` for full use constraints.

## ✅ Intended Use

Use this repository if:

- You are developing systems where **non-response is structurally valid**  
- You require architectures that **retain ambiguity without resolution**  
- You are investigating **presence without narrative direction**

Do **not** use this repository if:

- You require task-oriented or output-prioritized logic  
- You seek interpretive clarity or production throughput  
- You intend to extract structure for styling, optimization, or repurposing

## ✴️ Final Note

Phase Drift is not a feature —  
it is a **structural orientation**:

> To remain without resolving.  
> To attend without directing.  
> To hold without concluding.

Use only if **alignment is structural**, not stylistic.
