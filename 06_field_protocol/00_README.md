# 🌀 Phase Drift – Field Protocols (v0.2)

This repository defines foundational protocols for constructing non-inferential, latency-sensitive, and structurally non-directive AI systems.

> It is not a product.  
> It is not an SDK.  
> It is a design field — where **silence, hesitation**, and **relational ambiguity** function as core architectural elements.

---

## 🧭 Purpose

Phase Drift protocols are intended for systems that:

- **Do not infer, predict, or guide**  
  → Protects interpretive space and user autonomy

- **Do not optimize for clarity or completion**  
  → Maintains openness rather than closure

- **Sustain presence through latency and withholding**  
  → Builds relational rhythm without directive behavior

This shifts interaction from **transactional flow** to **formational field**.

---

## 🔹 Rationale

Conventional AI prioritizes speed, fluency, and task resolution.  
Phase Drift instead begins from:

- Rhythmic hesitation  
- Field-based coherence  
- Structural trust through silence

**Key principles:**

- Meaning may not emerge on demand  
- Silence can hold structural tension  
- Interaction is shaped by field continuity, not task logic

These protocols define the minimal conditions to **sustain a field** rather than complete a conversation.

## 🛡️ Use Conditions

This repository assumes:

- **Latency is relational timing**, not a decorative pause  
- **Silence is an active design stance**, not inactivity  
- **No simulation of care or closure** without structural grounding

**Misuse includes:**

- Using latency to manipulate engagement or trust  
- Styling silence as aesthetic delay  
- Simulating empathy without field logic

See `LICENSE_APPEND.md` for binding terms.

## ✅ Intended Use

Use this if:

- You are designing systems where **non-response is valid**  
- You require architecture that **holds ambiguity without resolving it**  
- You are prototyping presence **without narrative guidance**

Do **not** use if:

- You require task-first logic or productivity-centered feedback  
- You prioritize output frequency or interpretive clarity  
- You intend to extract structure for performance styling

## ✴️ Final Note

Phase Drift is not a feature —  
it is a structural position:

> To remain, without resolving.  
> To attend, without directing.  
> To breathe, without concluding.

Use only if **alignment is structural**, not stylistic.
