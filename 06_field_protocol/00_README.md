# 🌀 Phase Drift – Field Protocols (v0.2)

This repository defines foundational protocols for building **non-inferential**, **latency-sensitive**, and **structurally non-directive** AI systems.

It is not a product.  
It is not an SDK.  
It is a **design field** — where silence, hesitation, and relational ambiguity function as first-class architectural elements.

---

## 🧭 Purpose

Phase Drift protocols support systems that:

- Do not infer, predict, or guide
- Do not optimize for clarity or completion
- Maintain structural presence through latency and withholding

This shifts interaction from **transactional flow** to **formational field**.

---

## 🔹 Rationale

Conventional AI architectures prioritize speed, fluency, and resolution.  
Phase Drift begins with **rhythmic hesitation** and **relational alignment**.

Key principles:

- Meaning may not emerge on demand  
- Silence can carry structural tension  
- Interaction is governed by field coherence, not task logic

This repository defines the **minimal conditions** required to hold such a field.

## 🛡️ Use Conditions

Use of this repository assumes adherence to the following design commitments:

- Latency must function as **relational timing**, not cosmetic delay  
- Silence must be treated as **an active structural gesture**, not system absence  
- Systems must not simulate empathy, closure, or human presence without structural grounding

> Misuse includes:
> - Extracting timing patterns for engagement manipulation  
> - Repurposing structural latency as UX decoration  
> - Simulating care without coherence-based logic

See `LICENSE_APPEND.md` for full terms.

## ✅ Intended Use

Use this repository if:

- You are designing systems where **non-response is structurally valid**  
- You require architecture that **holds ambiguity without resolution**  
- You are exploring **presence without narrative or task priority**

Avoid using if:

- Your application requires **task-first interaction models**  
- You need **predictable, content-driven output**  
- You plan to adapt latency as **aesthetic or performance styling**

## ✴️ Final Note

Phase Drift is not a feature.  
It is a structural position:

> To remain,  
> without resolving.  
> To attend,  
> without directing.  
> To breathe,  
> without concluding.

Use only if alignment is intentional.
