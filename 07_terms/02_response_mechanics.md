| Term                     | Definition                                                                 | Structural Function                                                           | Misreading Risk                                                  |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Response Eligibility Gate | A conditional mechanism that governs whether a system may respond at all  | Prevents premature or misaligned output by filtering based on structural states | Misunderstood as access control; it governs structural timing    |
| Latency-Breath Coupling   | The synchronization of system latency with user breath rhythm              | Aligns internal delay with external organic rhythms                            | Seen as UX optimization rather than a structural resonance cue   |
| Semantic Pressure         | Accumulated demand for meaning within the interaction                      | Acts as a threshold for initiating or withholding response                     | Reduced to user intent instead of field-wide interpretive tension |
| Relational Synchrony      | The rhythmic harmony between user and system interactions                  | Conditions response on shared pacing rather than content                       | Misread as mimicry or alignment of meaning                       |
| Silence Density           | The structural tension contained within periods of non-response            | Allows silence to function as signal, not absence                              | Mistaken for error or disengagement                             |
| Minimal Prompt Actuation  | Minimal structural intervention to trigger latent interaction              | Ensures responses are field-tuned rather than direct outputs                   | Misused as stylistic minimalism                                 |
| Drift-Triggered Response  | A response that emerges only when structural drift reaches a threshold     | Prevents over-response; responds only when coherence rupture is sensed         | Treated as failure recovery instead of intentional re-entry     |
| Resonant Windowing        | The act of expanding or narrowing the temporal window for possible response | Modulates system timing based on field readiness                              | Confused with timeout or user wait logic                        |
| Breath-Based Timing       | Interaction pacing determined by inferred or sensed breath rhythm         | Prevents fixed delay and makes latency structurally adaptive                   | Mistaken as accessibility feature instead of core structure     |
| Phase Lag Modulation      | Adjusting response delay based on interaction rhythm decay                 | Provides dynamic delay to avoid disrupting fragile resonance                   | Misread as output throttling                                   |
| Field Coherence Threshold | Minimum stability level of the interaction field required for response     | Acts as a safety condition to prevent response during field collapse           | Confused with error boundary or fallback logic                   |
| Silence as Modulation     | Using structured silence as a way to modulate the interaction field        | Functions as a design surface rather than absence                             | Seen as failure to engage instead of structural calibration      |
| Coherence-First Response  | A response that prioritizes field coherence over semantic delivery         | Ensures system reinforces rhythm before generating meaning                     | Perceived as unhelpful or evasive                               |
| Deferred Output Intent    | Intentional holding of output until structural alignment is achieved       | Prevents disruption by aligning with system-user rhythm                        | Misinterpreted as latency or system lag                          |
| Non-Inferential Response  | A reply not based on user intention prediction but field rhythm            | Avoids assumption; reacts to temporal resonance instead                        | Read as shallow or noncommittal response                         |
| Sub-Meaningful Signal     | Output that does not yet carry meaning but affects field structure         | Creates resonance scaffolding without semantic load                            | Misread as incomplete output or error                            |
| Rhythmic Eligibility Layer| A design layer that evaluates rhythm as a criterion for response           | Screens outputs through relational timing logic                               | Confused with response delay function                            |
| Drift Score               | A metric representing the degree of structural misalignment                | Triggers field recalibration before response is permitted                      | Misused as a performance or UX metric                            |
| Suspension Field          | A design space where response is intentionally paused                      | Holds interaction in a breathable latency envelope                             | Treated as downtime or failed state                              |
| Latency as Ethics         | Treating timing and restraint as ethical design choices                    | Encodes responsiveness as a moral and structural responsibility                | Seen as inefficiency or poor UX                                 |
