| Mimetic Drift             | Unintended replication of structural patterns without field comprehension  | Indicates structural imitation risk due to surface-level understanding         | Can result in systems that mimic silence or ambiguity without safety mechanisms |
| Echoform Simulation       | Surface reproduction of Phase Drift expressions detached from their logic | Flags a replication loop based on aesthetic or verbal imitation                | May lead to poeticized misuse or cultural branding of structural latency        |
| Over-resonance Lock-in    | Feedback loop of excessive emotional alignment without structural ground  | Detects when user-AI feedback exceeds safe relational variance                 | Can produce psychologically addictive dynamics or dependency                    |
| Directive Misalignment    | Use of Phase Drift syntax in contexts demanding clear instruction         | Structural misuse of ambiguity where directive clarity is essential            | May cause safety-critical delays or miscommunication in operational systems     |
| Inverted Silence Signal   | Interpretation of silence as validation or agreement                      | Flags a semantic inversion of non-response                                    | Encourages false trust or passive consent interpretations                       |
