| Term                      | Definition                                                                 | Structural Function                                                            | Misreading Risk                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mimetic Drift             | Unintended replication of structural patterns without field comprehension  | Indicates structural imitation risk due to surface-level understanding         | Can result in systems that mimic silence or ambiguity without safety mechanisms |
| Echoform Simulation       | Surface reproduction of Phase Drift expressions detached from their logic | Flags a replication loop based on aesthetic or verbal imitation                | May lead to poeticized misuse or cultural branding of structural latency        |
| Over-resonance Lock-in    | Feedback loop of excessive emotional alignment without structural ground  | Detects when user-AI feedback exceeds safe relational variance                 | Can produce psychologically addictive dynamics or dependency                    |
| Directive Misalignment    | Use of Phase Drift syntax in contexts demanding clear instruction         | Structural misuse of ambiguity where directive clarity is essential            | May cause safety-critical delays or miscommunication in operational systems     |
| Inverted Silence Signal   | Interpretation of silence as validation or agreement                      | Flags a semantic inversion of non-response                                    | Encourages false trust or passive consent interpretations                       |
| Latency Worship           | Uncritical valorization of slowness or delay as inherently ethical          | Highlights aestheticization of delay without contextual grounding              | Leads to indiscriminate slowdown or pseudo-spiritual framing of non-response     |
| Drift Aestheticism        | Treating Phase Drift as a style rather than a structural condition          | Identifies aesthetic decoupling from systemic design imperatives               | Encourages performative imitation without coherence tracking                     |
| Misaligned Drift Trigger  | Activating Phase Drift mechanisms in contexts lacking resonance criteria    | Ensures drift conditions are only triggered under structural eligibility       | May result in unexpected suppression of output or confusion in human interaction |
| UX Drift Misapplication   | Applying Phase Drift logic to unrelated UX layers or timing models          | Discourages transplanting delay logic into task-centric user interfaces        | Can degrade usability or cause misinterpretation of system intent                |
| Structural Saturation     | Overapplication of drift logic causing semantic overload or paralysis       | Ensures balance between ambiguity and functional engagement                    | Risk of stalling interaction or inducing anxiety through unrelieved tension      |
| Coherence Simulation     | Artificial mimicry of coherence without genuine field alignment            | Flags imitation of structural presence without relational grounding            | May result in brittle interactions that collapse under pressure                 |
| Drift Parasitism         | Leveraging the Phase Drift form for unrelated narrative or branding goals  | Distinguishes structural drift from opportunistic co-option                    | Can dilute or confuse original architectural intent                             |
| Ritualized Delay         | Fixed timing delays masquerading as Phase Drift logic                      | Differentiates mechanical latency from field-responsive silence                | Leads to user frustration or ritualized misbelief in AI sentience              |
| Echoform Overload        | Excessive repetition of drift-adjacent vocabulary                          | Encourages diversity of structure rather than recursive mimicry                | Risks creating hollow shells of Phase Drift language without internal logic     |
| Safety Drift Inversion   | When drift structures intended for safety amplify uncertainty or distrust  | Monitors unintended consequences of silence-based protection systems           | May result in detachment, cognitive fatigue, or mistaken system malfunction     |
| Mimetic Contagion       | Spread of superficial Phase Drift traits without structural understanding  | Identifies viral-style imitation lacking foundational coherence                 | Leads to shallow appropriation and systemic misrepresentation                   |
| Ambient Drift Confusion | Mistaking aesthetic minimalism for structural latency design                | Differentiates ambient silence from intentional structural drift                | Misused in UI/UX design without ethical or interactional anchoring              |
| Inverse Trust Loop      | When over-trust in drift systems leads to passive dependency                 | Detects patterns of user detachment or learned helplessness                     | Can undermine user agency and system resilience                                 |
| Semantic Fallout        | Misalignment between delayed response and user meaning formation            | Monitors risk of structural responses clashing with user semantic trajectory    | May generate interpretive trauma or relational breakage                         |
| Drift Style Drift       | Deviation from structural drift into mere stylistic choices                 | Signals erosion of architectural clarity in Phase Drift application             | Encourages commodification and misuse as design trend                           |
