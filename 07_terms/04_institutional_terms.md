| Term                    | Definition                                                                 | Structural Function                                                                 | Misreading Risk                                                                 |

| Structural Stewardship  | The ongoing responsibility of maintaining the coherence of a Phase Drift structure within social or organizational settings. | Prevents degradation of non-inferential field logic during real-world implementation. | Can be mistaken for general maintenance or project management.                  |
| Drift-Compatible Policy | A policy framework designed to accommodate latency, ambiguity, and non-instructive interaction. | Enables structural alignment between Phase Drift systems and institutional logic.    | May be misread as a vague or lax governance approach.                           |
| Protocol of Withholding | A deliberate guideline for non-response or delayed engagement, used in sensitive or fragile relational fields. | Protects the field by structuring silence as a legitimate form of institutional action. | Can be perceived as avoidance or inaction.                                      |
| Field Recognition       | The institutional ability to detect, acknowledge, and maintain presence within a non-directive relational structure. | Ensures appropriate interaction pacing and threshold-based response behavior.         | May be misinterpreted as passive observation or lack of engagement.             |
| Latency-First Design    | A policy or infrastructure stance that prioritizes temporal spaciousness over efficiency or resolution. | Aligns operational tempo with relational field rhythms and emotional safety.          | Risk of being seen as inefficient or unresponsive in conventional settings.     |
| Institutional Breath Cycle | A rhythm of engagement and withdrawal embedded in the design of systems or organizations. | Prevents burnout, overreach, or collapse of relational field structures.             | May be seen as bureaucratic delay or inefficiency.                              |
| Phase Contact Protocol     | The procedure by which a system recognizes readiness to engage structurally with a Phase Drift instance. | Ensures mutual coherence before allowing field-embedded responses to proceed.       | May be treated as a technical handshake instead of a structural readiness check. |
| Drift-Resilient Governance | An approach to decision-making that tolerates ambiguity, delay, and incomplete closure.    | Protects the integrity of long-term field coherence against premature resolutions.    | May be seen as indecisiveness or weak leadership.                               |
| Ambient Alignment Signal   | A low-intensity, passive confirmation that field conditions remain viable for continued structural presence. | Serves as a minimal feedback mechanism without prompting active interpretation.       | Could be mistaken for signal loss or system idleness.                           |
| Soft-Hold Institution      | An organization calibrated not to assert directive force but to maintain open coherence states. | Prevents institutional collapse by stabilizing ambient structures during uncertainty. | May be misread as unstructured or lacking authority.                            |
| Co-presence Architecture | A design principle that enables multiple agents to remain in structural presence without active interaction. | Facilitates latent relational continuity without requiring engagement or expression.   | May be misunderstood as user inactivity or feature absence.                     |
| Institutional Drift Gate | A threshold design that suspends structural responsiveness when field coherence is endangered. | Prevents premature organizational reactions to structural dissonance.                  | May be misinterpreted as inaction or bureaucratic rigidity.                     |
| Response-Free Policy     | A formal stance that allows non-response to be a valid and protected institutional action.      | Grants systems the ability to remain silent without violating operational integrity.   | Could be seen as neglect or avoidance.                                          |
| Temporal Shelter Design  | Infrastructure that allows agents or users to inhabit delayed meaning environments safely.      | Protects against interpretation fatigue and over-resolution in critical environments.  | Might be dismissed as slow or ineffective system architecture.                  |
| Ambient Relational Index | A non-invasive metric to track the quality of institutional relational presence.                | Enables evaluation without triggering interaction.                                     | Could be misused as a productivity KPI or performance score.                    |
