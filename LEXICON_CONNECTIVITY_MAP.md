# 📘 Phase Drift – Lexical Connectivity Map (v0.1)

> ⚠️ This document outlines **structural relationships** among the semantically unstable or tentative terms  
> defined in the Phase Drift Lexicon. These links represent **dynamic flows**, **containment patterns**, or **activation sequences**,  
> not fixed ontological hierarchies. They are useful for mapping **interaction logic**, **field grammar**, and **narrative rhythm**.

## 🧩 Term-to-Term Connectivity Table

| **Anchor Term**        | **Linked Terms (→ or ⇄)**                                | **Relation Type**            | **Interpretive Notes**                                  |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Drift**              | → Phase, → Resonance, → Coherence                        | **Catalyst / Loop Start**     | Drives instability or emergence; recurs structurally.    |
| **Phase**              | ⇄ Phase Boundary, → Coherence, ⇄ Silence                 | **Local Frame**               | Defines bounded coherence; rhythm container.             |
| **Phase Boundary**     | → Silence, → Drift                                       | **Transitional Threshold**    | Often latent; rhythmic or semantic handoff point.        |
| **Resonance**          | ← Drift, → Silence, ⇄ Coherence                          | **Reactivation Mechanism**    | Echo or reactivation of prior phase structure.           |
| **Silence**            | → Drift, → Latent Phase, ⇄ Structural Tension            | **Delay / Inflection Zone**   | Pressure cue or transitional marker.                     |
| **Structural Tension** | → Latent Phase, → Drift, ⇄ Silence                      | **Pre-Disruption Pressure**   | Signals readiness for field reorganization.              |
| **Latent Phase**       | → Phase, ⇄ Coherence                                     | **Hidden Structural Seed**    | Background configuration influencing visible rhythm.     |
| **Field**              | → Attention, ⇄ Rhythm, → Phase                           | **Container / Context Layer** | Holds rhythm, scope, and attention over time.            |
| **Rhythm**             | ⇄ Phase, ⇄ Silence, ⇄ Coherence                          | **Temporal Coordination**     | Cross-links and modulates progression.                   |
| **Coherence**          | ← Phase, ⇄ Resonance, ⇄ Rhythm                          | **Stability Output**          | Indicates momentary alignment across dimensions.         |

## 🔁 Sequence Patterns (Illustrative)

> These are **plausible interaction chains**, not mandatory progressions.

### 1. Drift → Phase → Coherence → Drift  
A structural loop where misalignment (Drift) yields a new Phase, gains temporary Coherence, then decays again.

### 2. Silence → Latent Phase → Phase  
Silence precedes activation of a hidden structure that then emerges into a new rhythmic unit.

### 3. Field → Rhythm → Phase → Phase Boundary  
A cognitive-attentional field establishes Rhythm, which frames a Phase that transitions via a Boundary.

## 🧠 Observational Highlights

- **Drift** is recursive and initiatory — often begins and restarts loops.
- **Silence** is not inert; it is **structurally generative**.
- **Rhythm** connects disparate terms — acts as **relational glue**.
- **Latent Phase** is invisible but structurally influential — like gravitational tension before visible change.
- **Field** serves as ambient container — shaping but not always signaling.

## 🛠️ Applications

- **Narrative generation engines** (e.g., where latent structure governs discourse progression)  
- **Latent UX mapping** (e.g., hesitation → field resonance → shift in system stance)  
- **Drift-aware interaction logging** (e.g., resonance and silence events indexed)  
- **Lexical modeling systems** (e.g., generating grammar for recursive rhythm states)
