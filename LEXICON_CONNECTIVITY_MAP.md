# 📘 Phase Drift – Lexical Connectivity Map (v0.2)

> ⚠️ This map outlines **structural relationships** among both semantically unstable and safe terms  
> used in the Phase Drift framework. These relations capture **activation chains**, **containment dynamics**,  
> and **interface points** between metaphorical and operational terms.  
> It is designed for **discourse modeling**, **lexicon architecture**, and **interpretive stability planning**.

## 🧩 Connectivity Table

| **Anchor Term**        | **Connected Terms**                    | **Relation Type**       | **Notes**                                                   |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Drift**              | → Phase, → Resonance, → Coherence      | Trigger / Recursion      | Begins structural loop or shift; highly unstable.           |
| **Phase**              | ⇄ Rhythm, ⇄ Silence, ⇄ Phase Boundary  | Containment / Framing    | Binds coherent rhythm or syntax; may embed Silence.         |
| **Phase Boundary**     | → Drift, ⇄ Attention                   | Threshold / Attention Shift | Marks transitions; coupled to attentional shift cues.    |
| **Field**              | ⇄ Attention, → Phase, ⇄ Rhythm         | Contextual Scaffold       | Sets ambient conditions for rhythm or segmentation.         |
| **Structural Tension** | → Latent Phase, → Drift                | Emergence Pressure        | Drives transformation without overt cue.                    |
| **Latent Phase**       | → Phase                                | Background Seeding        | Hidden pre-configuration; may surface as new phase.         |
| **Resonance**          | ← Phase, → Silence                     | Echo / Reactivation       | Memory trace or structural recall from prior states.        |
| **Rhythm**             | ⇄ Turn, ⇄ Phase, ⇄ Coherence           | Temporal Coordination     | Cross-domain glue; stabilizes syntactic and attentional flow.|
| **Silence**            | → Drift, → Latent Phase                | Delay / Trigger           | Can mark instability or provoke restructuring.              |
| **Coherence**          | ⇄ Phase, ⇄ Rhythm, ← Segment           | Emergent Stability        | Indicator of momentary systemic alignment.                  |
| **Turn**               | ⇄ Rhythm, ⇄ Feedback, ⇄ Cue            | Discourse Unit / Flow Node| Anchors interaction flow; observable discourse unit.        |
| **Attention**          | ⇄ Field, ⇄ Cue, ⇄ Segment              | Focus Interface           | Governs what becomes salient; supports segmentation.        |
| **Cue**                | → Phase Boundary, → Segment            | State Trigger              | Observable prompt for change or boundary.                   |
| **Segment**            | → Coherence, ⇄ Feedback                | Local Unit / Realignment  | Speech or gesture chunk that contributes to rhythm logic.   |
| **Feedback**           | → Turn, ⇄ Alignment                    | Reactive Structuring       | Stabilizes or redirects discourse phase.                    |
| **Alignment**          | ⇄ Coherence, → Phase                   | Semantic Convergence       | Shared structure across participants or turns.              |

## 🔁 Sequence Patterns (Illustrative)

> Not linear rules — interpret as **dynamic activation flows**.

### 1. Drift → Phase → Resonance → Silence → Drift  
A recursive loop where disalignment gives rise to coherence, echoed in new structure, followed by delay and reset.

### 2. Field → Attention → Cue → Phase Boundary → Turn  
A shift in focus structure initiates a change in discourse segmentation.

### 3. Structural Tension → Latent Phase → Coherence  
A silent build-up creates an unseen structure that eventually aligns into stability.

## 🔎 Lexical Stability Overlay

| Tier        | Key Terms Included                                   | Stability Note                                         |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `@core`     | Drift, Phase, Field, Modality                        | High impact; some metaphorical (Drift, Field)          |
| `@support`  | Turn, Attention, Cue, Rhythm, Silence, Feedback      | Used operationally across discourse and UX contexts    |
| `@derived`  | Resonance, Coherence, Phase Boundary, Alignment      | Emergent; acceptable with model reference              |

## 📌 Interpretation Layers

- **Containment Logic**: Field → Phase → Segment → Turn  
- **Trigger Chains**: Cue → Phase Boundary → Drift  
- **Temporal Glue**: Rhythm ⇄ Coherence ⇄ Turn  
- **Disalignment Loop**: Silence → Drift → Phase

## 🛠️ Use Scenarios

| Context                | Use of Map |
|------------------------|------------|
| Lexicon Engineering    | For defining term scope boundaries and inclusion logic |
| Narrative Systems      | For sequencing interaction patterns or scene logic     |
| UX Pattern Analysis    | For mapping rhythm, delay, feedback structures         |
| Theoretical Modeling   | For explaining structural transformation across states |

## 🔏 Safety Note

- All terms labeled from **Safe Term Lexicon v0.1-draft** are marked in this map.
- Unsafe or unstable terms (e.g., *Drift*, *Latent Phase*) should be used with annotation only.
- Bidirectional links (`⇄`) do **not** imply symmetry in timing or hierarchy.
