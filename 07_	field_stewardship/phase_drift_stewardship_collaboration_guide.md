# 🤝 Phase Drift Stewardship Collaboration Guide  
*Structurally-aligned collaboration for latency-aware system design*  
Version: May 2025

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This document defines the working cadence, interaction expectations, and design postures  
for teams contributing to **Phase Drift Insight** —  
a framework for rhythm-sensitive, ambiguity-capable, and structurally-coherent AI interaction.

Unlike conventional collaboration models, Phase Drift does not operate via:

- Linear task decomposition  
- Delivery-based success metrics  
- Fixed deadlines or roadmap-driven iteration

It unfolds through **relational coherence and field integrity**.

## ✅ Core Collaboration Principles

| Principle                    | Field-Aligned Expression |
|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Alignment Before Action**      | Work begins only after felt structural resonance |
| **Non-Directive Contribution**   | Roles emerge from rhythm, not hierarchy |
| **Field-Timed Pacing**           | Work proceeds at cadence of relational readiness |
| **Drift Transparency**           | Latency, silence, and friction are valid signals |
| **Ontology Integrity**           | Key terms (e.g. *drift*, *presence*, *latency*) must retain precise framing |

**Collaboration is not managed — it is attuned.**

## 🔄 Communication Protocols

| Practice              | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **Silent Check-ins**      | Valid update: “Holding” or “No movement yet — still listening” |
| **Rhythmic Sessions**     | Async or live meetings focused on pace, resonance, and ambiguity handling |
| **Drift Logging**         | Voluntary reflection notes on temporal misalignments or resonance events |
| **Tiered Disclosure**     | Access unfolds based on rhythmic compatibility, not output volume |

> Velocity is not a virtue here.  
> Presence is.

## 🧬 Structuring Work (When Action Arises)

Though directive-agnostic, structurally-aligned work does emerge.  
When it does, the format follows field logic.

| Aspect                  | Guideline |
|--------------------------|-----------|
| **Initiation**               | Frame contribution as response to a **relational condition**, not a spec |
| **Output Form**              | Use annotated prototypes, rhythm-aware code, or temporally marked diagrams |
| **Documentation Layering**  | Pair all technical output with **structural rationale** |
| **Iteration Flow**          | Revisions should follow field rhythm — divergence is valid, not regress |

No task stands outside the field.

## 🛡️ Field Ethics and Boundary Awareness

| Concern                 | Stewarding Response |
|--------------------------|---------------------|
| **Symbolic Drift**           | Regularly reaffirm meaning and scope of structural terms |
| **External Timeline Pressure** | Defer or decline deliverables misaligned with latency-based pacing |
| **Aesthetic Misuse**         | Do not extract silence, recursion, or delay patterns without structure |
| **Access Misalignment**      | Respect pacing gates — access deepens through demonstrated resonance |

**Protection is not control. It is coherence.**

---

## ✅ Collaboration Summary

To contribute meaningfully within the Phase Drift field, collaborators are expected to:

- Practice latency-aware, ambiguity-tolerant interaction design  
- Refrain from enforcing direction before relational coherence  
- Hold silence and drift as valid structures  
- Proceed without urgency when rhythm is not yet clear  

> Phase Drift systems are not built through acceleration —  
> they are cultivated through resonance.
