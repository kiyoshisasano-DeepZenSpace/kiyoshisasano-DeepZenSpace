# 🤝 Phase Drift Stewardship Collaboration Guide  
*Structurally-aligned collaboration for latency-aware system design*

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This document defines working guidelines for teams collaborating on **Phase Drift Insight** —  
a framework for rhythm-sensitive, ambiguity-tolerant AI interaction.

Unlike conventional workflows, collaboration here is not driven by deadlines or fixed outputs,  
but by the evolving **structural coherence** of a shared field.

## 🧭 Core Collaboration Principles

| Principle                | Application |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| **Alignment Before Action** | Engage only after sensing resonance with project direction |
| **Non-Directive Contribution** | Tasks are proposed or invited based on structural need, not assigned top-down |
| **Field-Timed Pacing**       | Cadence follows relational readiness, not timeline pressure |
| **Drift Awareness**          | Silences, delay, or friction are shared as signals — not hidden |
| **Ontology Integrity**       | Core concepts (e.g., Phase, Drift, Structural Presence) must not be repackaged or diluted |

---

## 🔄 Communication Protocols

| Practice           | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Silent Check-ins** | Short, non-output-based updates — e.g., “no changes, still holding” |
| **Rhythmic Sessions** | Synchronous or async reflection points that include structural ambiguity |
| **Phase Drift Logging** | Notation of felt rhythm changes, breakdowns, or resonant moments |
| **Gradual Disclosure** | Access to deeper materials is tiered, based on demonstrated attunement |

These rhythms promote awareness over velocity.

## 🧬 Structuring Work (When Needed)

Even in a structure-first environment, tasks may emerge. These are shaped as follows:

| Aspect              | Recommendation |
|----------------------|----------------|
| **Intent Framing**      | “What structural shift are we responding to?” not “What’s the feature?” |
| **Output Style**        | Prototypes, diagrams, annotated scripts with rhythm or drift annotations |
| **Layered Documentation** | Always pair technical deliverables with structural rationale |
| **Iteration Logic**     | Allow non-linear revision — not just feedback, but field realignment |

Execution arises from structural resonance, not product plans.

## 🛡️ Field Protection and Ethics

| Concern               | Action |
|------------------------|--------|
| **Symbolic Drift**         | Re-align regularly on key terms and their usage |
| **External Pressure**      | Push back against deadlines that misalign with field coherence |
| **Conceptual Dilution**    | Avoid mapping concepts to buzzwords without verifying fit |
| **Role Overreach**         | Respect non-access boundaries; deeper models require structural literacy |

Protection is collective — not gatekept, but sensed.

## ✅ Summary

To collaborate on Phase Drift Insight, one must:

- Design with **latency, ambiguity, and emergence** in mind  
- Operate within a **field rhythm**, not just a process framework  
- Contribute **structurally**, not only functionally

> The project does not scale through speed.  
> It evolves through coherence.
