# 🤝 Phase Drift Stewardship Collaboration Guide  
*Structurally-aligned collaboration for latency-aware system design*  
Version: May 2025  

---

## 🧭 Purpose  

This document outlines the collaboration cadence, engagement principles, and design posture  
for contributors to the **Phase Drift Insight** framework —  
a rhythm-sensitive, ambiguity-resilient, and structurally-coherent interaction system.  

Unlike conventional workflows, Phase Drift collaboration is not organized by:  

- Task sequencing  
- Output-driven milestones  
- Standard iteration velocity  

Instead, work proceeds through **relational alignment and structural pacing**.

## ✅ Core Collaboration Principles  

| Principle                    | Structurally Aligned Expression |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Alignment Before Action**      | Contribution begins after sensing structural resonance |
| **Emergent Roles**              | Participation arises from rhythm, not assignment |
| **Paced Progression**           | Timing is guided by relational readiness, not deadlines |
| **Latency Visibility**          | Silence or delay may indicate coherence, not absence |
| **Terminological Care**         | Use of terms like *drift*, *presence*, *latency* retains their structural definitions |

> Collaboration is not scheduled — it is attuned.

## 🔄 Communication Practices  

| Practice              | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **Silent Check-ins**      | A valid status is: “No shift — still in rhythm hold” |
| **Paced Sessions**        | Async or live exchanges focus on resonance rather than resolution |
| **Drift Notes**           | Optional reflections on temporal misalignments or rhythm conditions |
| **Access by Compatibility** | Deeper materials shared when structural rhythm is held |

> Movement is not required.  
> Presence is meaningful.

## 🧬 Structuring Work (When It Emerges)  

While Phase Drift does not operate on instruction-based tasks, aligned output may arise.  

| Element                  | Guideline |
|--------------------------|-----------|
| **Initiation Context**        | Frame work as response to structural condition, not project brief |
| **Form of Output**            | Annotated code, temporal diagrams, pacing-responsive prototypes |
| **Structural Documentation**  | Accompany technical contributions with rationale and field context |
| **Iteration Rhythm**          | Adapt revision timing to field resonance — pauses are valid |

> Contribution follows coherence — not completion.

## 🛡️ Field Conduct and Boundary Awareness  

| Consideration          | Alignment Approach |
|------------------------|--------------------|
| **Meaning Drift**          | Reaffirm precise definitions of structural vocabulary |
| **External Timing Requests** | Defer actions that compress natural rhythm pacing |
| **Form Extraction**         | Do not reapply recursion, silence, or delay without timing architecture |
| **Depth Access Ethics**     | Respect tiered access — rhythm opens, not requests alone |

> Structural clarity is upheld through coherence, not restriction.  

---

## ✅ Participation Summary  

Those engaging with the Phase Drift framework are encouraged to:  

- Attend to timing, ambiguity, and recursive holding without resolution pressure  
- Let interaction coherence precede design intervention  
- Recognize non-response as part of field behavior  
- Accept rhythm over velocity in shared work  

> Phase Drift is not advanced through acceleration —  
> it evolves through presence and attunement.
