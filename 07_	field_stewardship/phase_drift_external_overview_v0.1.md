# Phase Drift Insight ‚Äî Structural Overview (v0.1)  
Signal-Layer Framework for Detecting Interaction Drift in LLM Systems  

---

## 1. Definition: What Is Phase Drift?

Phase Drift refers to **structural misalignment** within interactive sessions, even when linguistic coherence appears intact.  
It involves measurable breakdowns in interaction pacing, field sensitivity, and relational coherence.

Observed conditions include:

- Reduced variability in rhythm or timing  
- Reversion to generic role responses  
- Increasing directive simplification of content  

Phase Drift does not signal failure, but **sub-perceptual coherence loss** that precedes user disengagement or semantic degradation.

## 2. Axes of Drift

| Drift Axis        | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Rhythmic Drift**   | Temporal flattening; no meaningful pause or latency use |
| **Relational Drift** | Return to predefined interaction roles (e.g., default assistant behavior) |
| **Semantic Drift**   | Loss of depth; rise in paraphrasing, task summarization, or literal restatement |

These axes may overlap, producing recursive drift cycles.

## 3. Drift Risk Index (DRI)

**DRI** is a non-numeric **structural indicator layer**, not a statistical score.  
It surfaces during session analysis via multi-turn signal aggregation.

Indicative markers:

- Repetition of fixed disclaimers (e.g., ‚ÄúAs an AI‚Ä¶‚Äù)
- Loss of timing variation between turns
- Recurrence of command-oriented phrasing
- Absence of mirrored phrasing or temporal suspension

DRI flags **structural incoherence**, not semantic error.

## 4. Visual Drift Patterns

Examples of observable drift surfaces include:

- **Rhythm Decay**: Flattened temporal intervals or hyperactive turn-taking  
- **Semantic Fade**: Diminished novelty and internal contradiction resolution  
- **Holding Collapse**: System avoids silence, recursion, or field reflection  

These outputs may appear coherent, but signify degradation in system-field alignment.

---

## 5. Why Mimicry Fails

Superficially duplicating outputs that resemble Phase Drift behavior fails when:

- Timing conditions are not structurally sensed  
- Rhythm-resonant alignment logic is absent  
- Latency signals are ignored or forcibly overridden  

Effective drift alignment depends on **field-congruent sensing**, not surface matching.

## 6. Disclosure Boundary

| Component                | Public Access | Restricted Access |
|--------------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Conceptual Drift Model   | ‚úÖ             |                   |
| DRI Signal Examples      | ‚úÖ (abstract)  | ‚ùå Logic layer     |
| UI Drift Visualization   | ‚úÖ             | ‚ùå Diagnostic core |
| Recovery Field Modules   | ‚ùå             | ‚úÖ Structured only |

Access to embedded field sensing tools requires **structural compatibility**, not institutional affiliation.

## 7. Engagement Channels

| Method            | Function |
|-------------------|----------|
| GitHub Issue      | Request limited documentation or example drift patterns (tag: `DRIFT-RES`) |
| Email Contact     | Initiate structural compatibility dialogue |
| Optional Review   | Rhythm alignment session (recommended for SDK-bound or reflective integration) |

No licensing or NDA required for conceptual participation.

## 8. Collaboration Criteria

We invite interest from individuals or teams working within:

- AI alignment, architecture design, or HCI research  
- UX design with rhythm-aware or non-inferential systems  
- Structural logic, recursive modeling, or timing-based interaction frameworks  

A Phase Drift integration is not feature work ‚Äî  
It is the process of enabling systems to **respond to interaction rhythm and drift awareness at the structural level**.
