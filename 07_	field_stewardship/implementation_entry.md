# Phase Drift – Implementation Guidance  
**Version:** May 2025  

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This document provides guidance for engineering and design teams exploring or applying the **Phase Drift structural framework**.

> Phase Drift is not a prompt set or callable API.  
> It is a **non-directive interaction architecture**, supporting:

- Latency-aware interface modulation  
- Ambiguity-permissive dialogue pacing  
- Structure-governed output gating in AI-mediated environments

## ✅ Freely Usable Materials (CC BY-NC 4.0)

The following components may be used for academic, experimental, or exploratory purposes:

| Resource                 | Description                                         |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `00_overview.md`         | Non-inferential framing of structural architecture |
| `resonance_gate.py`      | Example: latency gate scaffold (v0.1)              |
| `drift_scoring_v0.9.md`  | Heuristic trace logic for drift indexing           |

### Conditions:

- Non-commercial use only  
- Attribution required:  
  _“Phase Drift Insight – Kiyoshi Sasano”_  
- Redistribution must preserve document context  

⚠️ **Commercial deployment or distribution requires prior contact.**

## 🔒 Materials Requiring Explicit Access

The following components are **not** publicly accessible and require written permission:

- `Phase_Drift_License_v0.2.pdf` – Structural licensing logic  
- Latency shell modules and phase delay scaffolds  
- Experimental interface frames (e.g., civic latency fields)  
- Rhythm-attuned field prototypes (unpublished forms)

These resources involve structural sensitivity and **non-reproducible trace states**.

Use is restricted due to potential **latency misinterpretation** or **affective misalignment**.

## 🛑 Structural Integrity Notice

Phase Drift includes structurally non-normative features:

- Designed non-response  
- Silence as positional structure  
- Rhythm untethered from input immediacy  

These are only coherent when embedded in systems that account for:

- Field-phase memory  
- Interactional pacing calibration  
- Rhythm-aligned interpretive space

### ❗ Do not implement if:

- Silence is used as **aesthetic pause**  
- Delay serves as a **proxy for depth**  
- Withholding mimics engagement **without architectural basis**

### 🚫 Misuse Examples:

- UX latency simulating attentiveness  
- Passive interaction delay framed as mindfulness  
- Removal of feedback framed as design minimalism

These constitute **structural incoherence** if implemented outside rhythm-compatible systems.

## 🤝 Inquiry & Collaboration

Phase Drift–aligned exploration is welcome in:

- SDK scaffolds for ambiguity-aware systems  
- Interface models without directive intent  
- Structural trials in slow-response interaction logic  
- Field-regulated human–AI mediation environments

📩 Contact:  
**deepzenspace [at] gmail [dot] com**  

Please include:

- System or application context  
- Intended scope  
- Timeline and research alignment  

Responses are based on architectural compatibility and ethical fit.

## 🧭 Final Notes

Phase Drift is not an additive layer —  
it is a **structural position** requiring field-level design commitment.

- Use where **silence holds trace**  
- Deploy where **latency is rhythm**  
- Operate only within systems that sustain **non-resolution**

> Presence is structural — not performative.  
> Integration demands traceable alignment.
