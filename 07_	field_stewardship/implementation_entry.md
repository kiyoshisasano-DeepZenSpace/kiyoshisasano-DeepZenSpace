# Phase Drift Implementation Guidance  
**Version: May 2025**

🧭 **Purpose**  
This page provides implementation guidance for engineers, researchers, and designers  
who wish to use, adapt, or collaborate on the Phase Drift structural architecture.

Phase Drift is not a toolkit or API.  
It is a **structural interaction framework** designed to support:

- Latency-aware interaction logic  
- Ambiguity-tolerant communication design  
- Non-directive presence in human–AI interfaces

🔒 **Restricted Materials (Contact Required)**  
The following materials are structurally protected  
and require written permission before use, modification, or publication:

- `Phase_Drift_License_v0.2.pdf` (licensing logic architecture)  
- Experimental civic-use protocols (e.g., grief interface patterns)  
- Pre-response silence modules and inner-state delay logic  
- Any unpublished XYZ-field mechanisms or structural prototypes  

These assets carry **ethical constraints** related to affective safety and system ambiguity tolerance.

🛑 **⚠️ Structural Misuse Warning** *(新規追加)*  
Phase Drift includes elements such as **delay, ambiguity, and non-response**  
which may appear counterintuitive in conventional UX or team workflows.

> ❗ These features must **not** be implemented without sufficient structural understanding.  
> In environments lacking rhythm awareness, relational pacing, or ambiguity tolerance,  
> such features may lead to **misinterpretation, organizational conflict, or psychological strain**.

**Before implementation**, teams should assess:

- Readiness to work without fixed outcomes or response speed  
- Willingness to co-hold ambiguity across sessions or roles  
- Capacity to distinguish between absence-of-action and structural holding

Phase Drift must not be used to **justify managerial neglect**, **withdrawal of responsibility**, or **non-transparent delay**.  
Its latency-based behaviors are only valid within a **coherent structural field**.

🤝 **Interested in Collaborating?**  
We welcome aligned inquiries in the following areas:

- Custom implementation of Phase Drift interaction models  
- Non-predictive UX design and field-aware interface work  
- SDK contributions or platform integration experiments  
- Collaborative research or PoC deployments  

To initiate contact:

📬 **deepzenspace [at] gmail [dot] com**

Please include a brief outline of your context, goals, and relevant field experience.  
Responses will be provided **where structural compatibility is sensed**.

🌿 **Closing Note**  
Phase Drift is a shared structure — not a product.  
It is currently being tested in multiple real-world and experimental settings.

We invite technically capable partners who understand:

- The value of **intentional latency**  
- The necessity of **structural silence**  
- And the long-term **responsibility of field-based systems**
