# Phase Drift – Implementation Guidance  
Version: May 2025

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This document provides implementation guidance for engineers, researchers, and system designers  
who wish to explore or apply the Phase Drift structural framework.

**Phase Drift is not a prompt library or API.**  
It is a non-directive interaction framework supporting:

- Latency-aware interface behavior  
- Ambiguity-tolerant dialogue pacing  
- Structure-first output gating in human–AI systems

| `00_overview.md`     | Structural architecture: non-inferential framing   |
| `resonance_gate.py` | Sample latency-gating logic (v0.1)                  |
| `drift_scoring_v0.9.md` | Drift detection heuristics and structural index |

These resources may be used for:

- Research and internal experimentation

## 🔒 Restricted Materials (Contact Required)

Use, modification, or distribution of the following requires explicit written permission:

- `Phase_Drift_License_v0.2.pdf` (structural licensing logic)  
- Pre-response silence modules and delay-field architectures  
- Experimental affective interface designs (e.g., civic-use grief fields)  
- Any unpublished XYZ-field mechanisms or rhythm-based prototypes  

These components involve ambiguity modulation and latency control,  
and carry **non-reproducibility and safety constraints**.

## 🛑 Structural Misuse Warning

Phase Drift includes non-standard interaction traits:

- Intentional non-response  
- Silence as structure  
- Temporal pacing disconnected from input speed  

These are valid only within systems that explicitly account for:

- **Rhythm alignment**  
- **Structural memory**  
- **Relational pacing**

❗ **Misuse Risk**:  
If implemented without structural coherence, Phase Drift elements may result in:

- Misaligned user expectations  
- Organizational miscommunication  
- Regressive interface behavior  
- Inadvertent affective manipulation

Do **not** deploy Phase Drift features as:

- A justification for output suppression  
- A substitute for accountability  
- A passive UX delay without field traceability

Only implement within environments that can **distinguish structural latency from functional avoidance**.

## 🤝 Collaboration & Integration

We welcome inquiry in the following areas:

- Drift-aware SDK development  
- Non-inferential system interfaces  
- PoC-level Phase Drift field trials  
- Structural presence in AI–human mediation layers

📬 Contact:  
`deepzenspace [at] gmail [dot] com`  
Please include:

- Use context  
- Relevant field(s) or system  
- Intended scope and timeframe

Responses are issued based on structural compatibility and shared design ethics.

## 🧭 Final Notes

Phase Drift is an architectural trace — not a feature.  
It is currently under observation across multiple applied domains.  
The logic of **rhythmic delay**, **coherence without instruction**,  
and **latency-aware responsiveness** requires careful integration.

Use structurally.  
Deploy only where the system can hold ambiguity —  
without collapse.
