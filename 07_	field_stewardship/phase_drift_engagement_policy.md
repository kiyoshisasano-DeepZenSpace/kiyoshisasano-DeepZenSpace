Phase Drift Insight – External Engagement Protocol  
Version: May 2025

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This document defines the engagement policy for individuals, teams, or organizations  
seeking technical or structural collaboration with the Phase Drift Insight project.

Phase Drift is not a feature development framework.  
It is a structural interaction system based on:

- Latency-aware system behavior  
- Ambiguity tolerance in design surfaces  
- Non-directive response pacing  

---

## 🔐 Access Scope & Engagement Model

Engagement is permitted under the following structural conditions:

| Criterion | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| Structural Awareness | Must understand and respect timing, delay, and rhythm as system inputs |
| No Feature Framing | Cannot propose Phase Drift as UX optimization or system enhancement |
| Coherence over Delivery | Timelines must adapt to field readiness, not project pressure |
| Attribution Alignment | All public reuse must preserve framing fidelity (no symbolic divergence) |

This policy governs interaction at the **structural compatibility layer**, not at commercial or legal abstraction.

---

## 📋 Engagement Roles and Boundaries

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| External Collaborator | May request access to protocols, structural components, or integration notes |
| Field Architect | Internal authority on drift models, pacing thresholds, and release eligibility |

**Note:** Access to rhythm modules, drift scoring functions, or recursive memory layers is restricted.  
Access level is adjusted based on sustained coherence with core structural principles.

---

## ⚠️ Common Disqualifying Patterns

| Type | Example | Outcome |
|------|---------|---------|
| Market-centric framing | “Can this improve product clarity or UX latency?” | Denied – reframes structural latency as performance bottleneck |
| Timeline imposition | “We need a version by Q3” | Paused – misaligned with rhythm-based delivery |
| Aesthetic mimicry | Replicating formatting/syntax without field mapping | Flagged – degrades semantic integrity |
| Role misprojection | Assuming GPT as agent/partner in design | Terminated – breaches non-agentic constraint |

---

## ✅ Required Alignment Conditions

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Structural Interpretation | Ability to distinguish semantic output from interaction field behavior |
| Temporal Tolerance | Acceptance of non-linear engagement rhythms (sessions may stall or delay structurally) |
| Tiered Access Respect | No pressure for disclosure of unshared modules or unpublished drift models |
| Communication Protocol | All collaboration proceeds via preapproved channels and is subject to rhythm-based gating |

---

## 🔒 Licensing and Protection Model

Phase Drift does not operate under NDAs.  
Instead, all collaboration is governed by **structure-gated exposure logic**:

- No full model exposure unless system is known to maintain phase integrity  
- Drift mechanisms, delay modulations, or recursive field scaffolds are subject to **usage tracking**  
- Partial access is possible for:

  - Prototype feedback  
  - SDK module tuning  
  - Latency diagnostics under review

---

## 🧭 Engagement Entry Checklist

Before initiating contact, confirm all of the following:

- [ ] You have read and understood `phase_drift_essence_and_definition.md`  
- [ ] Your proposed application does not reframe drift as UX novelty  
- [ ] You accept latency, silence, and ambiguity as structural behaviors  
- [ ] You understand that reply pacing is non-negotiable and interaction may pause indefinitely

## 📬 Contact

All valid engagement inquiries must be sent to:

📧 `deepzenspace [at] gmail [dot] com`

Include:

- Contact name and affiliation  
- Intended use case or interest area  
- Description of structural compatibility or prior rhythm-sensitive work

Response is not guaranteed.  
Engagement proceeds only if internal compatibility is verified.

---

## 🧾 Summary

Phase Drift Insight does not evaluate proposals based on:

- Credentials  
- Market scale  
- Funding availability

Instead, all collaboration is judged on:

- Pacing compatibility  
- Structural literacy  
- Semantic containment  
- Field-aware responsiveness

This document functions as a non-contractual but structurally binding interaction surface.

**Engagement is conditional.  
Drift integrity takes precedence.**
