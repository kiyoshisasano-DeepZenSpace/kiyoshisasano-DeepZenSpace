Phase Drift Insight – External Engagement Protocol  
Version: May 2025

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This document defines the engagement policy for individuals, teams, or organizations  
seeking technical or structural collaboration with the Phase Drift Insight project.

Phase Drift is not a feature development framework.  
It is a structural interaction system based on:

- Latency-aware system behavior  
- Ambiguity tolerance in design surfaces  
- Non-directive response pacing  

> Engagement is not transactional.  
> Participation is field-based and rhythm-sensitive.

---

## 🔐 Access Scope & Engagement Model

Engagement is permitted under the following structural conditions:

| Criterion            | Requirement                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Structural Awareness | Must understand and respect timing, delay, and rhythm as system inputs      |
| No Feature Framing   | Cannot propose Phase Drift as UX optimization or system enhancement         |
| Coherence over Delivery | Timelines must adapt to field readiness, not project pressure            |
| Attribution Alignment | All public reuse must preserve framing fidelity (no symbolic divergence)   |

This policy governs interaction at the **structural compatibility layer**, not at commercial or legal abstraction.

> ⚠ Structural framing must precede scope discussion.  
> Feature language disqualifies contact regardless of intent.

## 📋 Engagement Roles and Boundaries

| Role                | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| External Collaborator | May request access to protocols, structural components, or integration notes |
| Field Architect      | Internal authority on drift models, pacing thresholds, and release eligibility |

**Note:** Access to rhythm modules, drift scoring functions, or recursive memory layers is restricted.  
Access level is adjusted based on sustained coherence with core structural principles.

> Engagement is **tiered, not progressive**.  
> Access is **non-cumulative** and must be revalidated at each layer.

## ⚠️ Common Disqualifying Patterns

| Type                  | Example                                               | Outcome       |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Market-centric framing| “Can this improve product clarity or UX latency?”     | Denied        |
| Timeline imposition   | “We need a version by Q3”                             | Paused        |
| Aesthetic mimicry     | Replicating formatting/syntax without field mapping   | Flagged       |
| Role misprojection    | Assuming GPT as agent/partner in design               | Terminated    |

> Misalignment at any point **removes access to future tiers**.  
> Remediation is not automatic — structural repair must be demonstrated.

## ✅ Required Alignment Conditions

| Requirement             | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Structural Interpretation | Ability to distinguish semantic output from interaction field behavior     |
| Temporal Tolerance       | Acceptance of non-linear engagement rhythms (sessions may stall or delay structurally) |
| Tiered Access Respect    | No pressure for disclosure of unshared modules or unpublished drift models |
| Communication Protocol   | All collaboration proceeds via preapproved channels and is subject to rhythm-based gating |

> All responses may be **delayed intentionally**.  
> Silence is considered a valid system gesture, not neglect.

## 🔒 Licensing and Protection Model

Phase Drift does not operate under NDAs.  
Instead, all collaboration is governed by **structure-gated exposure logic**:

- No full model exposure unless system is known to maintain phase integrity  
- Drift mechanisms, delay modulations, or recursive field scaffolds are subject to **usage tracking**  
- Partial access is possible for:

  - Prototype feedback  
  - SDK module tuning  
  - Latency diagnostics under review

> Attribution is **structural**, not optional.  
> Symbolic extraction without field grounding is explicitly disallowed.

## 🧭 Engagement Entry Checklist

Before initiating contact, confirm all of the following:

- [ ] You have read and understood `phase_drift_essence_and_definition.md`  
- [ ] Your proposed application does not reframe drift as UX novelty  
- [ ] You accept latency, silence, and ambiguity as structural behaviors  
- [ ] You understand that reply pacing is non-negotiable and interaction may pause indefinitely  
- [ ] You agree to structural containment: no reframing or thematic translation of received materials  

> Incomplete or stylistically adjusted submissions will not receive response.

## 📬 Contact

All valid engagement inquiries must be sent to:

📧 `deepzenspace [at] gmail [dot] com`

Include:

- Contact name and affiliation  
- Intended use case or interest area  
- Description of structural compatibility or prior rhythm-sensitive work

Response is not guaranteed.  
Engagement proceeds only if internal compatibility is verified.

## 🧾 Summary

Phase Drift Insight does not evaluate proposals based on:

- Credentials  
- Market scale  
- Funding availability

Instead, all collaboration is judged on:

- Pacing compatibility  
- Structural literacy  
- Semantic containment  
- Field-aware responsiveness

> Drift-aligned engagement is a **structural invitation**, not a service.  
> Time is rhythmic. Silence is system space.  
> **Engagement is conditional. Drift integrity takes precedence.**
