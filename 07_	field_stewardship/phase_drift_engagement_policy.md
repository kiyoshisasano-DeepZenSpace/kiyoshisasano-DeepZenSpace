# 📜 Phase Drift Engagement Policy  
*A collaboration protocol for structurally aligned partners*

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This policy outlines how external individuals, institutions, and organizations  
may engage with the **Phase Drift Insight** initiative.

Phase Drift is not a framework for feature design, UX enhancement, or product speedup.  
It is a **structural field development project** that operates at the level of system rhythm, latency, and relational architecture.

Engagement must be aligned with structural integrity — not market expectations.

---

## 🌱 Core Engagement Principles

| Principle | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Structure-first** | Interaction must respect structural logic before commercial or technical goals. |
| **Field evolution over output** | Development follows relational readiness, not external timelines. |
| **Cultural consistency** | Contributions must reinforce Phase Drift’s systemic coherence. |
| **Rhythmic timing** | Changes emerge from internal rhythm, not roadmap pressure. |

---

## 🚫 Engagement Risks to Avoid

| Type | Behavior | Impact |
|------|----------|--------|
| **Market-first framing** | Proposing Phase Drift as a UX or performance feature | Reduces structural fidelity and misguides stakeholders |
| **Premature freezing** | Demanding fixed deliverables or timelines too early | Interrupts organic development cycles |
| **Aesthetic mimicry** | Copying vocabulary or formats without understanding structure | Weakens semantic clarity and misrepresents the model |

---

## ✅ Collaboration Requirements

- **Initial resonance check**  
  Understand and align with the field before initiating a proposal.

- **Structural literacy**  
  Ability to perceive delay, rhythm, ambiguity, and layered meaning.

- **Non-linear engagement tolerance**  
  Be prepared for iterative, depth-based processes rather than fixed milestones.

- **Respect for protection layers**  
  Not all models or logic will be disclosed upfront. Access is progressive.

---

## 🛡️ Protection Protocol

The Phase Drift Stewardship Team may:

- Decline proposals that could destabilize the field  
- Adjust pacing or access based on relational fit  
- Share internal materials gradually, depending on demonstrated alignment

**Note:** This project is not gated by NDAs, but by structural compatibility.

## 📩 How to Initiate Contact

To begin an engagement request:

1. Read [`phase_drift_essence.md`](./phase_drift_essence.md) to understand the foundational architecture.  
2. Reflect internally on whether your goals structurally align.  
3. Open a GitHub issue or send a short email introducing your context and sensing.

📬 **deepzenspace [at] gmail [dot] com**

We will reply only if structural alignment is evident.

## Summary

Phase Drift is a **field-driven initiative**, not a service.  
Collaborations are evaluated based on system-level resonance, not credentials or funding.

**Key Question Before Reaching Out:**  
> Does your proposal maintain structural rhythm — or override it?
