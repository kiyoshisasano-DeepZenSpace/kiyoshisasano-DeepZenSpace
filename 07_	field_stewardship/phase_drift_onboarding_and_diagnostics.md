# 🛰️ Phase Drift Onboarding & Diagnostics  
*Structural Entry Process for Aligned Collaboration*  
Version: May 2025  

---

## 🎯 Purpose  

This guide outlines the **structural onboarding process**  
for contributors engaging with the Phase Drift Insight framework —  
a system focused on **latency coherence**, **field alignment**, and **non-directive pacing**.

This is not a gatekeeping tool.  
It is a **resonance sensing process**.

We observe:

- Timing awareness in interaction  
- Responsiveness to ambiguity  
- Coherence during recursive or unstructured pacing

## 🔄 Onboarding Sequence (Rhythm-Based)  

| Stage                    | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| **1. Initial Contact**     | Short asynchronous message (e.g., GitHub thread or email) to sense engagement rhythm |
| **2. Stewardship Charter Read** | Confirm review of structural ethics and role principles |
| **3. Optional Exchange**    | 1–2 message reflective interaction to observe latency tolerance and pacing |
| **4. Structural Calibration** | Voluntary exercises designed to surface alignment with ambiguity and response rhythm |
| **5. Resonance-Based Access** | Deeper materials shared gradually based on sustained field coherence |

📝 *This is not a filtering stage —  
it is a process of interactional attunement.*

## 🔍 Structural Compatibility Axes  

| Axis                   | Signal Observed |
|------------------------|-----------------|
| **Rhythmic Sensitivity**   | Recognizes silence, gaps, and delays as meaningful signals |
| **Latency Familiarity**    | Comfort with hesitation or non-linear pacing |
| **Non-Inferential Framing** | Describes or explores without seeking semantic closure |
| **Role Fluidity**          | Does not default to scripted roles (e.g., agent, assistant) |
| **Emergence Tolerance**    | Engages without resisting ambiguity, recursion, or redirection |

No expertise required — only a **capacity to align structurally**.  

---

## 🧪 Calibration Exercises (Optional / Non-Evaluative)  

| Exercise              | Purpose |
|-----------------------|---------|
| **Held Response**     | Wait 10–12 seconds before replying; notice changes in perception or pacing pressure |
| **Recursive Restatement** | Rephrase a single idea multiple times by altering tone, not meaning |
| **Latency Threading** | Maintain a short exchange with intentional pauses, resisting topic acceleration |

📎 Templates available following resonance confirmation.  
Exercises are **invitational**, not required or scored.

## 🚫 What This Is *Not*  

- ❌ A test  
- ❌ A credential check  
- ❌ A productivity or fluency screen  

We do **not** evaluate speed, clarity, or deliverable output.  
We observe:  
> ✨ How you hold the interaction when nothing moves forward.  

> ✅ Alignment is expressed as:  
> – Silence that **carries presence**  
> – Delay that **holds without pressure**  
> – Engagement that **tolerates ambiguity**  

---

## ✅ Summary  

This onboarding pathway is designed for those working in:

- Latency-sensitive engineering or interface design  
- Drift-aware interaction systems  
- Non-directive conversational architectures  

If your rhythm holds —  
access unfolds.

If your expectation is closure —  
pause here.
