# 🛰️ Phase Drift Onboarding & Diagnostics  
*Structural entry process for aligned collaboration*

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This guide outlines the onboarding and diagnostic process for collaborators engaging with **Phase Drift Insight** —  
a system architecture focused on latency-aware interaction, ambiguity tolerance, and field coherence.

Rather than task metrics or delivery speed, this process emphasizes:

- Structural timing awareness  
- Comfort with recursive rhythm  
- Compatibility with non-linear engagement flow

## 🔄 Onboarding Process Overview

| Stage                | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| 1. Initial Alignment | Short message or GitHub issue to observe interaction style and rhythm sensitivity |
| 2. Charter Review    | Read and confirm understanding of the Phase Drift Stewardship Charter |
| 3. Optional Session  | Walkthrough of key design concepts, drift indicators, and interface risks |
| 4. Light Diagnostics | Voluntary perceptual tasks to observe structural behavior (see below) |
| 5. Progressive Access| Internal files and models shared based on observed rhythm-fit over time |

📝 *Note: This is not a pass/fail process. Entry evolves based on rhythm and alignment.*

## 🔍 Diagnostic Dimensions

| Dimension           | Focus |
|---------------------|-------|
| **Rhythm Sensitivity** | Ability to perceive timing shifts and silence as interaction signals |
| **Latency Tolerance**  | Comfort with gaps, non-response, or ambiguity |
| **Structural Framing** | Describes work in structural or relational terms, not just goal execution |
| **Role Flexibility**   | Engages without requiring clear identity roles (e.g., “coach,” “assistant”) |
| **Non-Linearity**      | Tolerates emergent direction rather than predefined milestones |

These are not performance metrics. They are **behavioral indicators of compatibility** with structural environments.

## 🧪 Optional Exercises (Soft Calibration)

| Exercise           | Objective |
|--------------------|-----------|
| **Pause Response** | Practice delaying a reply to sense structural timing shifts |
| **Recursive Framing** | Re-express a concept at 2–3 structural depths without expanding meaning |
| **Latency Dialogue** | Continue a thread with pacing awareness over content direction |

Templates for each are available upon request after onboarding initiation.

## 🚫 What This Is *Not*

- Not a recruitment process  
- Not a credential filter  
- Not a fast-track to system access  

We do **not use conventional metrics** — instead, we assess:

- Temporal pacing  
- Structural reflectivity  
- Relational modulation  

> Success in this context is:  
> **“Interaction reflects structural field coherence over task resolution.”**

---

## ✅ Summary

This onboarding prepares contributors for:

- Building latency-aware interaction systems  
- Working with timing-based structural drift sensors  
- Supporting relational coherence in high-complexity architectures  

Entry is determined by **field compatibility**, not titles or output volume.
