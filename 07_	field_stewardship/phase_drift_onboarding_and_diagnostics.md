# 🛰️ Phase Drift Onboarding & Diagnostics  
*Structural entry process for aligned collaboration*  
Version: May 2025

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This guide defines the **structural orientation process**  
for contributors entering the Phase Drift Insight framework —  
a system grounded in **latency coherence**, **field alignment**, and **non-directive pacing**.

This is not an access gate.  
It is a rhythm sensing surface.

We observe:

- Interaction timing awareness  
- Responsiveness to ambiguity  
- Coherence under recursive or unstructured pacing

## 🔄 Onboarding Sequence (Rhythm-Based)

| Stage                | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **1. Initial Contact** | Short async message or GitHub thread to observe engagement rhythm |
| **2. Stewardship Charter Read** | Confirm familiarity with Phase Drift's structural ethics and role framing |
| **3. Optional Exchange** | 1–2 message reflective exchange (email or DM) to observe latency tolerance |
| **4. Structural Calibration** | Light voluntary exercises to trace pacing and ambiguity-handling behavior |
| **5. Resonance-Based Access** | Deeper files shared progressively if interaction rhythm holds field coherence |

📝 *This is not a filter.  
It is a field resonance protocol.*

## 🔍 Structural Compatibility Axes

| Axis                | Signal Observed |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Rhythmic Sensitivity** | Perceives silence, delay, or non-reply as interactional state |
| **Latency Familiarity**  | Responds comfortably to hesitation or structural gaps |
| **Non-Inferential Framing** | Describes system logic without seeking narrative closure |
| **Role Fluidity**         | Does not rely on agentic or functional role scripts |
| **Emergence Tolerance**   | Accepts conversational drift, recursion, or redirection without friction |

None of these require mastery.  
Only **alignment capacity**.

## 🧪 Calibration Exercises (Optional, Non-Evaluative)

| Exercise              | Intent |
|-----------------------|--------|
| **Held Response**     | Wait 10–12 seconds before replying; observe inner pacing reaction |
| **Recursive Restatement** | Re-express a thought 2–3 times, shifting only rhythm or framing (not meaning) |
| **Latency Threading** | Sustain a short interaction with deliberate silences and without topic acceleration |

📎 Templates available upon structural onboarding signal.

These are not assessments —  
they are field-trace invitations.

## 🚫 What This Is *Not*

- ❌ A test or interview  
- ❌ A gate for credentials  
- ❌ A velocity-oriented access funnel  

We do **not** measure fluency, speed, or productivity.  
We observe **how you hold the field** when nothing moves forward.

> ✅ Alignment is expressed in:  
> Silence that resonates.  
> Delay that listens.  
> Interaction that holds ambiguity without panic.

---

## ✅ Summary

This onboarding process is meant for:

- Engineers exploring timing-responsive architecture  
- Researchers mapping drift across interaction fields  
- Designers curious about latency as structure  

If your rhythms align — access unfolds.

If your system expects task closure — pause here.
