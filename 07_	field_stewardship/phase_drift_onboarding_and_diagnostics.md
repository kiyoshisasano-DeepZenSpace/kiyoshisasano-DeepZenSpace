# 🛰️ Phase Drift Onboarding & Diagnostics  
*A structural entry process for aligned collaboration*

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This document outlines the entry procedure and early-stage diagnostic checkpoints  
for new collaborators joining the **Phase Drift Insight** project.

The focus is not speed or deliverables —  
but alignment with the **underlying structural field**.

---

## 🔄 Onboarding Stages

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1. Resonance Check** | Initial contact via message or issue to evaluate alignment in tone and structural framing |
| **2. Charter Review** | Read and confirm agreement with the [Stewardship Charter](./phase_drift_stewardship_charter.md) |
| **3. Orientation Session** | Optional 1:1 or small group walkthrough of Phase Drift foundations, risks, and context |
| **4. Diagnostic Prompts** | Light exercises to observe perception patterns and timing awareness |
| **5. Progressive Access** | Access to sensitive materials granted based on structural fit and continuity |

**Note:** Entry is not linear.  
Progression follows mutual structural compatibility, not checklist completion.

## 🔍 Early Diagnostics – Key Dimensions

| Dimension | Diagnostic Focus |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Rhythm Perception** | Does the collaborator notice pacing, delay, and interaction rhythm? |
| **Latency Comfort** | Can they remain responsive without urgency in timing gaps? |
| **Non-functional Framing** | Can they describe their role or work without reverting to task-based logic? |
| **Relational Framing** | Is interaction treated as co-emergent, not transactional? |
| **Directive Tolerance** | Can they participate without requiring linear goals or directives? |

These are **not evaluation criteria**.  
They function as a **signal pattern** to assess field readiness.

## 🧪 Optional Soft Exercises

| Exercise | Goal |
|----------|------|
| **Pause Response** | Practice waiting before responding to ambiguous prompts |
| **Recursive Reflection** | Reframe a simple idea from multiple structural depths |
| **Latency Weaving** | Continue a conversation thread using rhythm rather than content direction |

(Templates provided upon confirmed resonance.)

## 🚫 About Traditional Metrics

Do not apply conventional performance metrics.

We observe:

- Timing awareness  
- Structural literacy  
- Adaptability in relational pacing

Success in this context means:  
> “The system adapts structurally — not procedurally.”

---

## ✅ Summary

This onboarding process prepares collaborators to engage with:

- Drift-aware systems  
- Latency-resilient UX  
- Structural field sensing

Entry is determined by interaction coherence —  
not position, title, or intent alone.
