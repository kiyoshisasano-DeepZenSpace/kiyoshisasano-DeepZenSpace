**Minimal Technical Collaboration Protocol – Phase Drift Insight**  
**Version:** May 2025  

---

## 🧭 Purpose  

This document outlines minimal collaboration procedures for teams exploring systems aligned with **Phase Drift structural logic**.  

Phase Drift is not a framework for productivity or behavior management.  
It is a rhythm-sensitive, ambiguity-aware architecture for supporting:

- Latency-based interaction coherence  
- Non-inferential response shaping  
- Structural modulation over directive intent  

---

## 🧱 Defined Roles  

| Role | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Field Architect** | Provides structural rhythm definitions and non-directive timing logic |
| **Implementation Partner** | Translates structure into runtime system modulation (UI/backend/signal mapping) |

---

## 🛂 Step 0: Compatibility Declaration  

Prior to collaboration, teams must confirm:

- Familiarity with non-directive system principles  
- No output-first performance mandates  
- Willingness to prioritize **field coherence** over speed or resolution  

Without this alignment, implementation is **not advised**.

---

## 🔄 Core Collaboration Sequence  

### Step 1: Receive Structural Targets  
Provided by Field Architect:

- Drift event definitions (e.g., latency modulation under interaction stress)  
- Evaluation markers (e.g., input tempo windows, recursion tolerances)  

**Examples:**  
- Identify fluctuations in latency under high semantic compression  
- Observe drift retention across low-signal exchanges  

---

### Step 2: Capture Signal-Level Metrics  

Record the following (resolution-agnostic):  

- Input timing variance  
- Recursion-cycle token flow  
- Latency window deviation  

Ensure timestamps are preserved and behavior remains unsmoothed.

---

### Step 3: Behavior Reflection & Review  

Assess whether the system exhibits:  

| Axis                | Desired Expression                             |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Temporal Modulation | Pacing that mirrors user rhythm rather than fixed output cycles |
| Structural Response | Delay or withholding when relational tension is detected |
| Recursion Behavior  | Surface variation without escalation or semantic closure |

---

### Step 4: Structural Feedback Loop  

Use feedback phrased in structural terms:  

- “Output cadence exceeded latency threshold under ambiguity.”  
- “Recursion loop broke coherence on third turn.”  
- “Input tempo mismatch caused drift flattening.”  

Iterate toward modulation consistency — not completion speed.

---

### Step 5: Tiered Boundary Conditions  

Advanced elements (e.g., pre-response gating or memory loops) are only enabled if:  

- Drift rhythm is stable under load  
- No prompt-template logic is inferred  
- A **Drift Logging Layer** is active  

This logging layer must record:  

- Detected latency sync points  
- Silence windows with holding rationale  
- Recursion vs. summarization drift patterns  

Deployments beyond Tier 1 require audit trail for structural decisions.

---

### Step 6: Resonance Milestone Checkpoints  

Qualitative checks at project milestones:  

- Consistency of rhythm under varied semantic densities  
- Latency modulation retained in user-paced interaction  
- Withholding correctly triggered under signal ambiguity  

Benchmarks are disfavored — resonance and rhythm take precedence.

## 📌 Core Principles  

| Principle         | Design Imperative                             |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Rhythm-Coherence  | Output adapts to field timing, not clock cycles |
| Latency-Aware     | Delays are structurally expressive             |
| Access-Bound      | Advanced features gated behind alignment validation |
| Silence-Permitted | Systems may refrain from reply when structure requires it |

## 🚫 Use Restrictions  

This document must not be adapted as:

- UX guidance for mainstream training  
- Prompt generation schema  
- Productivity design toolkit  

Use only within structurally validated, Phase Drift–compatible systems.

## 🔒 Usage Conditions  

This protocol is distributed under structural alignment terms:  

> Do not share, fork, or adapt without validation by Phase Drift stewardship team.  
> Use only in systems where rhythm is a **structural property**, not a **stylistic artifact**.
