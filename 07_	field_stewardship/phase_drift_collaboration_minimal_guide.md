# 🌌 Phase Drift Insight — Minimal Collaboration Guide  
*Version: May 2025*

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This document defines the **minimum collaboration structure** for engineers, researchers, and design teams  
working with the Phase Drift Insight framework.

Phase Drift is not a product specification — it is a structural system.  
Your role is to implement code that responds to rhythm, timing, and interaction drift.

---

## 🏗️ Collaboration Roles

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Field Architect** | Defines structural conditions, phase behaviors, and drift parameters |
| **Implementation Partner** | Builds technical systems (frontend/backend/data) based on structural input |

---

## 🔄 Basic Workflow Overview

### 1. Receive Structural Targets

- Field Architect provides:
  - Specific drift phenomena to detect  
  - Metrics to monitor (latency, rhythm, etc.)

**Example Implementation Targets:**

- Detect scroll rhythm disruption and flag as `latency_drift`  
- Track cumulative drift score over time during long sessions

---

### 2. Define and Capture Metrics

- Capture relevant data signals:
  - Input delays  
  - Session rhythm patterns  
  - Temporal irregularities

**Examples:**

- Log gaps between scroll events  
- Timestamp phase transitions based on user pacing

---

### 3. Review System Behavior

- After build, verify not only feature behavior but **field alignment**.

**Core Checkpoint:**  
> Does the system feel responsive to rhythm shifts — or just execute logic?

If timing feels rigid, review for loss of relational fidelity.

---

### 4. Integrate Field Feedback

- Typical feedback types may include:
  - “Latency fluctuation too subtle”
  - “Phase transition not perceptible”

- Adjust gradually. Prioritize **rhythmic coherence** over raw functionality.

---

### 5. Respect Depth Boundaries

- Access is **tiered**.  
  - Deep structural models may be withheld until compatibility is confirmed.  
  - Work only at the exposed operational level.

This ensures safety and coherence at higher structural layers.

---

### 6. Validate Resonance at Milestones

- At key checkpoints:
  - Is the system increasing **field sensitivity**?  
  - If not, pause — optimize for rhythm, not throughput.

---

## 🧱 Core Principles

| Principle | Application |
|----------|-------------|
| **Structure-first** | Don’t simplify implementation at the cost of structural integrity |
| **Field-responsive** | System must adapt to interaction pacing and drift |
| **Depth-tiered** | Higher layers require demonstrated compatibility |
| **Relational over deadline** | Timelines adapt to resonance — not vice versa |

---

## 📌 Summary

You are not just delivering a feature set.  
You are contributing to a **live structural environment**  
that requires timing awareness, drift sensitivity, and relational design logic.

**Success Metric:**  
> The interface feels *attuned* — not just functional.
