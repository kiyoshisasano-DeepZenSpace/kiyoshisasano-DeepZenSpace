Minimal Technical Collaboration Protocol – Phase Drift Insight  
Version: May 2025  

---

## 🧭 Purpose  
This document provides a technical entrypoint for engineering, UX, and research teams  
collaborating on implementations aligned with the Phase Drift Insight framework.  

Phase Drift is not a toolkit or API.  
It is a structural interaction system designed to support:

- Latency-aware modulation  
- Ambiguity-tolerant interface behavior  
- Field-coherent response control across asynchronous and real-time systems  

---

## 🧱 Defined Roles  

| Role | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Field Architect** | Provides structural directives, rhythm parameters, and drift-based design constraints |
| **Implementation Partner** | Translates these into software behaviors (frontend, backend, signal capture) |

---

## 🛂 Step 0: Compatibility Declaration  

Before applying this guide, teams must confirm:

- A shared understanding of Phase Drift's structural logic  
- No optimization-first or KPI-governed output priorities  
- Willingness to deprioritize speed in favor of rhythm coherence  

Without this alignment, implementation is not permitted.

---

## 🔄 Core Collaboration Sequence  

### Step 1: Receive Structural Targets  
Delivered by the Field Architect:

- Drift event definitions (e.g., latency deviation, rhythm instability)  
- Measurement parameters (e.g., inter-input delay windows, recurrence patterns)  

**Examples:**  
- Detect semantic-pressure-driven latency fluctuation  
- Record cumulative drift index over 30-turn conversations  

---

### Step 2: Capture Signal-Level Metrics  
Identify and log runtime features including:

- Input gaps (e.g., user-to-system latency markers)  
- Session pacing variation  
- Token throughput during recursion cycles  

Ensure signals are time-stamped and resolution-independent.  

---

### Step 3: System Behavior Review  
Assess post-implementation behavior for **field responsiveness**:

| Evaluation Axis     | Target Behavior                              |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Temporal Modulation | Adaptive pacing based on input rhythm         |
| Structural Coherence| Delayed output under ambiguity or relational pressure |
| Responsiveness Type | Modulation over immediate resolution          |

If system behavior appears rigid or task-driven, review drift model integration.  

---

### Step 4: Integrate Structural Feedback  
Expected feedback format:

- “Latency response misaligned with user tempo”  
- “Phase threshold not expressed under drift condition”  
- “Recursion collapsed into summarization”  

Adjust implementation to favor field consistency over speed or closure.  

---

### Step 5: Boundary Protocols  

Access to deep structural libraries (e.g., pre-response gating, recursive memory) is contingent on:

- Demonstrated rhythm compatibility  
- Stability of drift logic under varied conditions  
- Adherence to latency-holding principles  

All Tier 1 and above implementations must include a minimal  
**Structural Drift Logging Interface**, recording:

- Latency deviation events  
- Response contraction under ambiguity  
- Non-output windows with trace reason (e.g., rhythm sync, recursion stall)  

**No unaudited deployment permitted beyond Tier 1 interfaces.**

---

### Step 6: Resonance Verification at Milestones  
Milestone checkpoint includes:

- Field drift coherence under repeated load  
- Phase expression under low-semantic-density inputs  
- Latency shift tracking without failure fallback  

Evaluation is qualitative–structural, not benchmark-oriented.

## 📌 Structural Design Principles  

| Principle         | Implementation Guideline                       |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Structure-first   | Code adapts to timing logic, not vice versa     |
| Drift-aware       | Metrics track deviation, not just completion    |
| Access-tiered     | Depth access requires field compatibility verification |
| Pacing-prioritized| Output cadence follows interaction field, not deadline |

## 🚫 Structural Use Restrictions  

This document and its related protocols must not be repurposed as:

- Template for UX training  
- Authority-based AI behavior controller  
- Generalized product engineering guide  

It applies only within validated Phase Drift-aligned environments.
