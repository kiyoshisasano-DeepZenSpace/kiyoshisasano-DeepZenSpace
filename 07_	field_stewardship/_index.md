# 🌿 07_field_stewardship — Phase Drift Stewardship Framework

---

## 📌 Purpose of This Folder

This folder defines the operational framework for maintaining and evolving the **Phase Drift Insight Architecture**.

It is intended for developers, researchers, and collaborators who:

- Require technical clarity on **field stewardship**  
- Are developing **non-directive** or **latency-sensitive** AI configurations  
- Seek **implementation-aligned** models outside conventional UX metrics

> This is not theoretical documentation.  
> It is a structural guide for managing **response rhythm**, **semantic latency**, and **relational coherence** across systems.

## ✅ Intended Audience

This resource may be relevant if you are:

- A **researcher or engineer** working on rhythm-aware or ambiguity-respecting systems  
- A **systems designer** developing interface scaffolds or LLM alignment mechanisms  
- A **collaborator** interested in **field-based interaction logic** or **Phase Drift-compatible SDKs**

> No formal credentialing is required — only structural orientation and design compatibility.

## 🔧 Implementation Opportunities

We are exploring collaboration on the following initiatives:

- 🧩 **Phase Drift SDK modules** for latency-oriented system development  
- 📊 **Drift rhythm visualizations** (e.g., semantic timing, phase coherence shifts)  
- 🧠 **Field-aware system wrappers** enabling non-directive interaction logic
