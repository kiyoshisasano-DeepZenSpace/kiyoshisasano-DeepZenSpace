# 🌿 09_field_stewardship — Phase Drift Stewardship Framework

---

## 📌 Purpose of This Folder

This folder defines the operational structure for maintaining and scaling the **Phase Drift Insight architecture**.

It is intended for developers, researchers, and collaborators who:

- Need technical clarity on field stewardship  
- Are exploring non-directive or latency-aware AI interfaces  
- Seek implementation-ready alignment models beyond traditional UX metrics

> This is not conceptual theory.  
> It’s an applied structure for managing response rhythm, semantic delay, and relational coherence across systems.

## ✅ Who This Is For

This resource is relevant if you are:

- A **researcher or engineer** building AI systems sensitive to ambiguity and pacing  
- A **systems designer** working on LLM wrappers or new interface paradigms  
- A **collaborator** interested in field-based interaction logic or SDK design

No formal credentials are required.  
What matters is structural alignment and design compatibility.

## 🔧 Implementation Opportunities

We are actively exploring collaboration on:

- **Phase Drift SDK modules** for AI systems  
- **Drift detection visualizations** (timing, semantic, relational)  
- **Field-aware AI wrappers** with soft-latency interaction logic
