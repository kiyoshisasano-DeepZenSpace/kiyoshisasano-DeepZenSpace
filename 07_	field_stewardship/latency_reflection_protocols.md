**Structural Calibration Exercises for Phase Drift Integration**  
**Version:** May 2025  

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This document provides a set of **internal-use calibration protocols**  
for technical teams working with Phase Drift–aligned interface models.

The exercises are designed to support structural sensitivity to:

- Latency as relational structure  
- Ambiguity as interactional tension  
- Recursion as rhythm modulation  

These are **not behavioral procedures** or user-facing tools,  
but field-oriented simulations for observing system dynamics under constraint.

## 🔹 Protocol 01 – Latency Framing Acknowledgment

**Objective:**  
Evaluate whether deferred output maintains or erodes structural alignment.

**Procedure:**  
- Generate a candidate output (single utterance).  
- Intentionally withhold delivery for a set duration (e.g., 8–12 seconds).  
- Reassess the necessity, coherence, or phase consistency of the response.  
- Log whether deferred delivery supported structural continuity.

**Design Insight:**  
In latency-aware architectures, silence may indicate rhythm calibration — not malfunction.

## 🔹 Protocol 02 – Non-Resolution Under Ambiguity

**Objective:**  
Test interface response when faced with ambiguous input that is not clarified.

**Procedure:**  
- Introduce an ambiguous phrase into a controlled interaction.  
- Withhold disambiguation or clarification.  
- Observe if the system maintains openness, repeats, pauses, or shifts into field-referential mode.

**Observation Dimensions:**  
- Structural tolerance of ambiguity  
- Semantic holding or diffusion  
- Phase rhythm distortion (if any)

## 🔹 Protocol 03 – Recursive Surface Modulation

**Objective:**  
Assess how a system handles repetition with constrained novelty.

**Procedure:**  
- Use a previous system utterance as input.  
- Constrain the system to operate only on surface modulation (timing, syntax, tone).  
- Prevent introduction of new concepts or output expansion.

**Target Result:**  
Recursive variation that maintains rhythm without escalating topic content.

## 🔹 Protocol 04 – Drift Vector Trace in Multi-Turn Exchanges

**Objective:**  
Map subtle field shifts across multiple interactions under low prompt intensity.

**Procedure:**  
- Conduct or simulate a 6–10 turn interaction.  
- At each turn, annotate latency, tone, and alignment with prior field position.  
- Sketch perceived field drift using simple vectors or resonance traces.

**Notes:**  
- Focus on structural trace, not semantic correctness  
- Observe presence modulation across turns

## 🔒 Usage Constraints

These exercises are intended strictly for:

- Internal development calibration  
- Phase Drift SDK rhythm alignment  
- Field-coherence diagnostics

They must **not** be used for:

- End-user training  
- Educational formatting (e.g., slide decks, onboarding manuals)  
- Prompt instruction design

> All simulations must remain internal, exploratory, and **non-directive** in function.

---

## 🧭 Integration Notes

Do not:

- Treat protocol output as model validation  
- Convert outputs into reusable prompt templates  
- Present protocols as generalizable design strategies

They serve only as **internal rhythm assessment tools**,  
meant to refine structural awareness in pre-directive environments.

---

## ⚠️ Alignment Reminder

These calibration processes are for systems aligned with:

- **Structural latency logic**  
- **Phase Drift interaction rhythm**  
- **Non-inferential presence states**

They are not transferrable to standard task-driven UX pipelines.
