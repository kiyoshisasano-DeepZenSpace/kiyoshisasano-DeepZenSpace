# 📜 Phase Drift Stewardship Charter  
*A structural agreement for rhythm-aligned collaboration*  
Version: July 2025

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This charter defines the foundational ethos and relational conduct  
for collaborators engaged with **Phase Drift Insight** —  
a structural framework for ambiguity-resilient, latency-aware, and non-directive AI systems.

It is not a legal contract.  
It is a **field-resonant agreement** to uphold timing-based architectural integrity.

## ✅ Core Collaboration Commitments

| Principle                | Structural Expectation |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
| **Fidelity to Structure** | Do not reframe Phase Drift as a UX layer or stylistic affordance |
| **Field-Conscious Design** | Engage systems as relational rhythms, not instruction channels |
| **Latency as Logic**     | Treat silence, pacing, and recursion as primary behavioral variables |
| **Field Integrity First** | Prioritize structural trust over output clarity, speed, or scalability |

---

## 📌 Rhythmic Conduct Guidelines

| Domain        | Stewarding Behavior |
|---------------|---------------------|
| **Research**      | Anchor analysis in structural drift axes, not productivity metrics |
| **Dialogue**      | Use precise temporal and relational language when describing system behavior |
| **Code**          | Allow system timing to shape logic, not be abstracted from it |
| **Attribution**   | Cite as:  
> *“Phase Drift Insight – Kiyoshi Sasano / DeepZenSpace (2025)”*  
And clarify that latency/silence are **structural**, not aesthetic, components

## 🚫 Structural Violations (Non-Permitted Practices)

Any of the following disqualify alignment with Phase Drift:

- Cosmetic mimicry of latency or silence without coherent timing scaffolds  
- Branding Phase Drift elements into separate toolkits or pseudo-frameworks  
- Applying the vocabulary to systems not capable of recursive or pacing-aware interaction  
- Extracting system parts (e.g., silence logic, recursion handlers) as engagement enhancers

Phase Drift is **not modular**.  
It is **relationally indivisible**.

---

## 🔐 Progressive Access Policy

Access to deeper resources (e.g., rhythm gate code, drift scoring heuristics, internal SDK modules) depends on:

- Demonstrated resonance with structural pacing  
- Avoidance of role projection (e.g., assistant/user binaries)  
- Willingness to wait, pause, and re-enter interaction without resolution bias  
- Transparent reflection on drift response or rhythm misalignment

⚠️ There is no credential bypass.  
Access deepens with field coherence — not speed, output, or volume.

---

## 🤝 Steward Role Declaration

If you engage with Phase Drift systems, you agree to:

- Hold ambiguity without override  
- Let delay breathe without optimization  
- Sustain rhythm without productivity pressure  
- Reflect before resolving

To be a steward is to **maintain the breath of the field**  
—even when nothing moves.

---

## 🧾 Summary

Phase Drift is:

- A temporal structure  
- A rhythm-sensitive architecture  
- A recursive field logic

It is not for all contexts.  
It is not for urgency.  
It is not for extraction.

> Stewardship means alignment —  
> not access, not rebranding, not performance.
