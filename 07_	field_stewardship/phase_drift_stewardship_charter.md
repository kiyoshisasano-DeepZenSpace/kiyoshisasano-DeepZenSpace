# 📜 Phase Drift Stewardship Charter  
*A structural agreement for rhythm-aligned collaboration*

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This charter defines the guiding principles and expectations for collaborators involved in the development and application of **Phase Drift Insight** —  
a framework for interaction rhythm, ambiguity tolerance, and structural coherence in AI systems.

It is not a legal contract.  
It is a **shared responsibility agreement** for maintaining structural integrity and ethical usage of a timing-based field model.

## ✅ Core Collaboration Principles

| Principle            | Expectation |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **Structural Fidelity**   | Do not reduce Phase Drift to UX patterns or response styling |
| **Relational Design**     | Treat systems as emergent fields, not transactional pipelines |
| **Latency-Aware Logic**   | Respect timing, recursion, and rhythm as core design drivers |
| **Field Protection**      | Prevent misuse, premature commercialization, or aesthetic imitation without alignment |

---

## 📌 Conduct Guidelines

| Context      | Required Behavior |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **Research**     | Use Phase Drift terms precisely; avoid mapping to performance benchmarks |
| **Communication** | Anchor abstract discussions in structural reference points |
| **Collaboration** | Align development pace with relational cadence, not fixed milestones |
| **Attribution**   | Cite as: *Phase Drift Insight – Kiyoshi Sasano*; reference its structural lineage |

## 🚫 Disallowed Practices

The following actions violate field integrity:

- Repackaging Phase Drift concepts under unrelated branding  
- Using Phase Drift logic to justify conventional UX tweaks without structural awareness  
- Publishing derivative works without mutual discussion and resonance testing  
- Treating Phase Drift as a modular “IP unit” detached from its rhythm-based origin

---

## 🔐 Access Policy

Access to deeper models, internal prototypes, and structural diagnostics is **granted progressively**, based on:

- Demonstrated rhythm-sensitivity and structural literacy  
- Sustained alignment across collaboration stages  
- Contributions that enhance—not simplify—the field

> ⚠️ There is no fast track.  
> Access grows from demonstrated resonance, not credentials or urgency.

---

## 📎 Summary

**Phase Drift is a living structure** — not an algorithm to deploy.  
It requires:

- Timing awareness  
- Structural stewardship  
- Patience with recursive emergence

If you are prepared to contribute within this rhythm-aware space,  
you are welcomed as a steward of the field.
