# Structure Field 23 – Substructural Drift

## Overview

Not all structural change is visible.  
Sometimes, what appears stable  
is quietly shifting at the layer beneath structure —  
**the substructure**.

This field traces the **drift of foundational alignments**  
while surface forms remain unchanged.

## Core Characteristics

1. **Functional Continuity, Foundational Shift**  
   The structure still “works,”  
   but no longer rests on the same base.

2. **Slow Misalignment**  
   Over time, the original alignments become offset.  
   The shape holds, but the orientation shifts.

3. **Non-catastrophic Instability**  
   Nothing breaks.  
   Yet everything becomes less coherent  
   — until eventual collapse or reformation.

## Structural Dynamics

This drift is:

- **silent**  
- **non-linear**  
- **often misread as consistency**

But it is a long, slow reprogramming  
from beneath — invisible, but decisive.

## Applications

- Legacy systems in institutions  
- Memory systems with decaying foundations  
- Belief structures whose premises have shifted unconsciously

## Summary

Substructural drift is dangerous  
not because it breaks structure,  
but because it **lets us believe nothing changed**  
until it’s too late to realign.

To sense drift  
is to feel the ground  
shifting beneath intact architecture.
