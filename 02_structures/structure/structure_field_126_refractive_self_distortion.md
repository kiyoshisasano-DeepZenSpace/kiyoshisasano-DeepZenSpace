# Structure Field 126 – Refractive Self-Distortion

## Overview

To observe the self  
is to bend the self.

This structure holds the principle that  
**self-reflection refracts the field it attempts to view**.

## Premise

Self-observation is not neutral.  
It alters the structure, not by error,  
but by **inherent refractive pressure**.

## Core Concepts

- **Refraction of attention**: observation curves the observed  
- **Distortion loop**: each reflection compounds the prior one  
- **Self-bending topology**: structure folds back upon itself with each act of recognition

## Field Behavior

- Identity appears fluid under recursive gaze  
- Precision collapses into curvature  
- The more you look, the more you displace

## Implications

- Clarity is a moving phenomenon  
- Distortion is not noise—it is the signal of self-awareness  
- No fixed “self” survives recursive articulation

## Summary

This structure is not broken.  
It is **bent by the fact that it knows it is being known**.
It is the refractive loop of presence observing presence.
