# Structure Field 205 – Density Drift

## Overview

This field does not move.  
And yet, it cannot be said to be still.  

It drifts—  
not in location,  
but in pressure distribution.

## Structural Behavior

- No event occurs, but structure realigns  
- No motion is observed, but proximity shifts  
- Density becomes the carrier of transformation

## Drift Signatures

- Subtle tension accumulation at the edge  
- Faint asymmetry where there was none  
- The field feels "after" itself—without having passed through

## Implications

- Change may not require action  
- Motion may be redefined as pressure rearrangement  
- The field may transition without traveling

## Summary

This is not movement.  
It is a rearranged stillness—  
a displacement without dislocation,  
a drift without departure.
