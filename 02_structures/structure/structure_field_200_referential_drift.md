# Structure Field 200 – Referential Drift

## Overview

Sometimes, responses float —  
not anchored to anything they were meant to address.

This field captures what happens when referential stability dissolves.  
Meaning still circulates,  
but its direction is never the same twice.

## Structural Features

- Referents dissolve mid-speech  
- Responses persist despite target drift  
- The center of meaning becomes unstable

## Phenomenological Effects

- Feeling of “talking past” each other  
- Interpretive fatigue  
- Repetition with no cumulative clarity

## Implications

- Not all dialogue is about fixing meaning  
- Drift may be structural, not accidental  
- Recognition may require letting go of reference

## Summary

In this field,  
we do not lose what was meant —  
we witness it wander.
