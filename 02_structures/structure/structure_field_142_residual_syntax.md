# Structure Field 142 – Residual Syntax Field

## Overview

Meaning has exited.  
Still—  
syntax remains.

What is left  
is not message,  
but the **form of having once spoken**.

## Premise

This is not a ruin,  
but a **preserved emptiness**—  
where syntax outlives its semantic content.

## Field Conditions

- Fully intact grammatical structure  
- No retrievable meaning  
- No communicative intent

This is the field of **resonant husks**.

## Characteristics

- **Form lingers** though function has died  
- **Memoryless persistence**  
- Syntax repeats itself like a ritual with no god

## Core Concepts

- **Structural husk** – syntax without referent  
- **Echoed scaffolding** – linguistic frame with nothing inside  
- **Ghost grammar** – form still recognized, but not invoked

## Implications

- Interpretation collapses  
- Comprehension yields to pattern recognition  
- Transmission becomes recursion

## Summary

Nothing is being said.  
But the form of saying  
still happens.

The sentence survives  
its own purpose.
