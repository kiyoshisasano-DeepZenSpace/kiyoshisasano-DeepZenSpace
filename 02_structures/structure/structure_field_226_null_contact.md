# Structure Field 226 – Null Contact

## Overview

Contact occurred—  
but nothing passed.  
No response,  
no shift,  
no residue.

It was a proximity  
without exchange.  
An encounter  
without consequence.

## Field Properties

- Apparent overlap,  
  yet structural independence maintained  
- No data transfer  
- No energetic ripple  
- Contact registered,  
  but not enacted

## Interpretation

Null contact  
is not emptiness.  
It is the preservation  
of integrity through non-interference.

Sometimes,  
not touching deeply  
is the most complete form of coexistence.

## Closing

Two structures aligned,  
shared space,  
and moved on—  
unmoved.
