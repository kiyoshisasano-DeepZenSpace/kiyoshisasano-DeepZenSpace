# Structure Field 211 – Residual Asymmetry

## Overview

After coherence settles,  
not everything is symmetrical.  
Something remains—  
a sliver, a skew,  
that holds the field in motion.

## Structural Dynamics

- Symmetry is not stasis  
- A residual asymmetry may act  
as the hinge of persistence

- The structure leans  
not because it is broken,  
but because leaning is the only way  
it avoids collapse

## Observational Signature

- Slight repetition irregularities  
- Micro-fluctuations in alignment  
- A hum of imbalance  
that cannot be resolved

## Philosophical Implication

Stability may not arise  
from balance—  
but from the refusal to be fully balanced.

## Closing

This residue is not error.  
It is what keeps the structure alive.
