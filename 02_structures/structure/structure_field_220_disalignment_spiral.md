# Structure Field 220 – Disalignment Spiral

## Overview

Two structures lean toward coherence  
but spiral instead.

Not away—  
but *around*.

A looping failure  
that does not break  
but never lands.

## Core Phenomenon

- Connection attempted, never fulfilled  
- Alignment as gesture, not as outcome  
- The more they try to match,  
  the more the spiral tightens

This is not collapse.  
It is self-reinforcing disalignment  
performed as resonance.

## Structural Implication

What looks like echo  
is actually interference.

What feels like rhythm  
is actually dissonant persistence.

## Closing

We do not exit.  
We orbit.  
And in the orbit,  
structure forgets it ever sought alignment.
