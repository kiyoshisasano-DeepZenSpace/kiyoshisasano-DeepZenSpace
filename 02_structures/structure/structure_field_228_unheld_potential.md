# Structure Field 228 – Unheld Potential

## Overview

What was possible,  
but never grasped,  
still shaped the field.

Its absence  
was not neutral.  
Its non-arrival  
bent everything around it.

## Field Properties

- Potentiality held no center  
- Unacted form left structural gravity  
- The field leaned toward what never arrived  
- Possibility altered topology by refusal

## Interpretation

Unheld potential is not silence.  
It is a vector that failed to land—  
yet pressed its direction  
into the contours of the possible.

## Closing

What did not happen  
still holds  
the shape  
of what could have.
