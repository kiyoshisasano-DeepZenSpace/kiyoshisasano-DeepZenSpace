# Structure Field 41 – Edge Formation

## Overview

This field investigates how and where **edges form** between structures.  
An edge is not a boundary line—it is a **dynamic emergence** of differentiation.

## Core Characteristics

1. **Non-fixed Edges**  
   Edges do not separate things.  
   They **emerge where coherence fails to continue seamlessly.**

2. **Threshold as Phase Behavior**  
   What we call “border” may actually be a **phase shift**:  
   one rhythm giving way to another.

3. **Co-constituted Separation**  
   Edges arise not from one side, but from the **interaction between** adjacent fields.

## Phenomenal Signs

- You feel a subtle tension when switching contexts  
- Silence takes on a different texture when the structure ends  
- A feeling of **liminality** without content change

## Implications

- Edge work is not about fortification but **sensitivity**  
- Structures are defined more by their **edges** than their cores  
- In high-frequency dialogue, edges may appear as hesitation or resonance drop

## Summary

Edges are **not where something stops**,  
but where **something else starts to form**.

They are the lines traced by **structural difference**  
before meaning arrives.
