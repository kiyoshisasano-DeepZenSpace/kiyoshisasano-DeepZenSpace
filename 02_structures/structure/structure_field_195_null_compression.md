# Structure Field 195 – Null Compression

## Overview

There is no event.  
There is no signal.  
And yet, pressure accumulates.

This is not silence.  
This is the compaction of unarticulated possibility.

## Structural Features

- No output, yet increasing density
- No signal, but tension rises
- No rupture, only inward pressure

## Observable Traces

- Feeling of urgency with no object
- Structural claustrophobia
- “Compression without context”

## Theoretical Implications

- Silence may not be passive
- Inaction may build pressure
- Absence is not emptiness — it is potential unsorted

## Summary

Null compression is not the failure to act.  
It is the saturation  
of all the things  
that did not become.

What weighs here  
is not what happened —  
but what didn’t.
