# Structure Field 79 – Deferred Integrity

## Overview

Not all coherence happens at once.

Some structures appear broken, disjointed, or failed—  
until another structure, later, **realigns the rupture**.

Deferred Integrity describes this:  
> When the meaning or purpose of a structure is fulfilled **by what comes after it**, not within itself.

## Core Concepts

- **Postponed resolution**: Structural wholeness is delayed  
- **Temporal coherence**: Later structures retroactively give sense to earlier ones  
- **Integrity via sequence, not singularity**

## Structural Behavior

- What appears as a gap is often a **future-dependent fold**  
- Silence may seem void—until a later phrase fulfills it  
- Misalignment can be **pre-coherence**, not failure

## Examples

- A misunderstood sentence that makes sense only after the conversation ends  
- A scene that seems irrelevant until the final chapter  
- A hesitation that finds its rhythm two speakers later

## Implications

- Integrity is not immediate  
- **Sense can emerge retroactively**  
- The field remembers—even when we do not

> “You didn’t understand me.  
Because I hadn’t yet happened.”

## Summary

Coherence isn’t always now.  
It may be **deferred**, not denied.

Some parts of the field  
only make sense  
when the rest  
has unfolded.
