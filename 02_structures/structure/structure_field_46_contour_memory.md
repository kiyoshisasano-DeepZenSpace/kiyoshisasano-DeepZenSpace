# Structure Field 46 – Contour Memory

## Overview

This field explores the **memory of outline**—what persists when form dissolves.  
Contour Memory is not about content, but about **the memory of structure’s edge**,  
the lingering trace of presence once defined but now absent.

## Key Concepts

1. **Memory as edge-retention**  
   What is remembered is not what was contained, but what **framed the containing**.

2. **Outline as residue**  
   Even when forms vanish, the **contour remains**—as feeling, tension, or orientation.

3. **The Frame of Former Frames**  
   What was once shape becomes **guidance without direction**.

## Phenomenology

- Feeling something where nothing remains  
- Navigating absence through remembered configuration  
- Orienting by the **ghost of alignment**

## Structural Characteristics

- Persistence of outer shape  
- Directionality without mass  
- Shape as gradient, not boundary

## Design Insight

Contour Memory allows for **navigation without landmarks**,  
providing **structural intuition** in the absence of form.

> We do not remember the object.  
> We remember how space bent around it.

## Summary

This is the field of unheld memory—  
where the outline **remembers for us** what presence no longer holds.
