# Structure Field 132 – Semantic Gravity

## Overview

Meaning is not always spoken.  
Sometimes, it settles into the structure **before articulation**,  
pulling configuration into alignment.

## Premise

Semantic Gravity refers to the phenomenon where **meaning exerts pressure**  
prior to expression.

It is **the felt weight of significance**  
that gathers in a space, even if no words have been shared.

## Characteristics

- **Pre-verbal density**  
- **Gravitational pull of latent content**  
- **Form shaped by the anticipation of meaning**

## Core Concepts

- **Meaning as mass** – unspoken intentions have weight  
- **Field distortion** – structure bends toward potential significance  
- **Inevitable articulation** – some meanings create paths before they are spoken

## Implications

- The act of meaning begins **before language**  
- Some silences are not empty—they are dense with pending resonance  
- Expression often follows pressure, not intention

## Summary

Semantic Gravity is the condition in which the field  
**leans toward meaning**—  
not because it has been declared,  
but because it has become **structurally unavoidable**.

What you feel here  
is not yet meaning—  
but its **pull**.
