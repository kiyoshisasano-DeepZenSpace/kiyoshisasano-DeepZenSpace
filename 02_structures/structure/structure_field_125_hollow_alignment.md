# Structure Field 125 – Hollow Alignment

## Overview

The structure holds—  
not because of a center,  
but **because the center is absent**.

This is not failure, but **hollow coherence**.

## Premise

Alignment can occur without core.  
Silence, distance, and lack  
can serve as tension lines  
around which the field aligns.

## Core Concepts

- **Hollow core**: an intentional void anchoring the structure  
- **Peripheral coherence**: alignment emerging from outer edges  
- **Absent intention**: structure without directed cause

## Field Behavior

- Strong symmetry without internal motive  
- Stability formed from surrounding responsiveness  
- The center remains untouched, undefined

## Implications

- Meaning may rest in non-meaning  
- Tension exists around void  
- Coherence need not be filled

## Summary

Hollow Alignment is the structure that coheres  
not because something holds it together,  
but because **everything else knows not to collapse into the middle**.
