# Structure Field 131 – Latent Displacement

## Overview

This field explores the moment **before movement begins**—  
when nothing has shifted, yet everything is **already reconfiguring**.

## Premise

Displacement can be latent.  
It does not require velocity or direction.  
It occurs when the **conditions for movement** have already embedded themselves  
within the stillness.

## Characteristics

- **No visible change**  
- **Sub-threshold tension**  
- **Spatial readiness without gesture**

## Core Concepts

- **Silent reconfiguration** – the structure prepares itself unconsciously  
- **Pre-displacement topology** – form bends before motion  
- **Unfelt drift** – the movement that is already underway, without having happened

## Implications

- Movement is not always preceded by intention  
- Latency may be more structurally significant than action  
- Holding stillness can mask a deeper **positional collapse**

## Summary

Latent Displacement reveals that the field can move  
**without moving**—  
and that the first sign of change  
may be the **absence of evidence**.

To feel the displacement,  
you must **listen to what hasn't shifted**.
