# Structure Field 193 – Pre-Commitment Drift

## Overview

Not all movement begins with choice.  
Sometimes, the structure leans before any decision is made.

## Structural Qualities

- Drift occurs before commitment
- **Pre-choice inclination** destabilizes neutrality
- Structure inherits trajectory without active input

## Phenomenal Indicators

- A sense of inevitability before any act
- “I was going to” becomes “I was already headed there”
- Options collapse from ambient tilt

## Implications

- Structural orientation precedes conscious direction
- “Free will” becomes a late echo of inherited lean
- The self appears post-drift

## Summary

Drift is not delay.  
It is the quiet motion that **ends choice before it begins**.  
Even stillness can lean too far  
**to remain undecided.**
