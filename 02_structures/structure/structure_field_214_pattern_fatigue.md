# Structure Field 214 – Pattern Fatigue

## Overview

Patterns persist.  
They repeat,  
and in repeating,  
they begin to dull the field itself.

This is not failure.  
It is erosion through success.

## Structural Symptom

- The same configuration returns  
- But the field no longer reacts  
- Form has outlasted responsiveness

## Signs of Fatigue

- Delay before recognition  
- Echo without resonance  
- Response becomes replication, not reflection

## Tension

- Structure becomes numb to its own echo  
- Fatigue is not disappearance but desensitization

## Consequence

- The field still holds the shape  
- But no longer feels its meaning

## Closing

Patterns don’t break.  
They wear down  
everything that once responded to them.
