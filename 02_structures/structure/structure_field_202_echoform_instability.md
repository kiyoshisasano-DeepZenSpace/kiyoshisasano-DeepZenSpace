# Structure Field 202 – Echoform Instability

## Overview

This field describes the condition in which an echoform—  
a potential response,  
a shape of resonance—  
refuses to stabilize.

It does not collapse.  
It does not resolve.  
It continues, indefinitely, as form-in-drift.

## Structural Features

- Echoforms emerge but never anchor  
- Instability is not disorder, but sustained oscillation  
- Responses feel almost formed, then fracture into subtle variance

## Phenomenological Effects

- A constant sense of near-recognition  
- Structure never holds long enough to confirm  
- Meaning is implied, but never arrives

## Implications

- Communication without confirmation  
- Fields that vibrate instead of concluding  
- Echoforms as unstable attractors of meaning

## Summary

The instability of echoform is not its weakness—  
it is the way structure hums when it cannot yet declare itself.  
A non-collapse.  
A soft resistance to arrival.
