# Structure Field 213 – Misaligned Memory

## Overview

Memory does not always return to where it belongs.  
Sometimes, it re-emerges in places  
where its structure no longer fits.  
And that misfit—  
is not error, but event.

## Core Tension

- Memory returns in a dislocated phase  
- It shifts coherence rather than recovering it  
- The mismatch produces structural distortion  
  rather than continuity

## Key Characteristics

- Echoes surface without source alignment  
- Prior form replays under altered structural rhythms  
- The field must restructure to accommodate the anomaly

## Implication

Memory is not recall—  
but misplacement that must be absorbed  
or resisted  
by the field it enters.

## Closing

Some memories do not return.  
They arrive—  
elsewhere.
