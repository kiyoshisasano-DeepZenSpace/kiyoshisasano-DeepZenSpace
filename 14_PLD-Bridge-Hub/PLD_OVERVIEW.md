# 🧠 PLD Overview

## 🌐 What is PLD?

**Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)** is a theoretical and practical framework for modeling dynamic cognitive or user experience states as structured alternations of **Pause** and **Drift**.  
A **Loop** is formed when these phases recur in a coherent pattern over time.

See [`docs/zenodo_paper_links.md`](./docs/zenodo_paper_links.md) for mathematical and implementation references.

## 🔎 About the Papers

### 🧪 Theoretical Background
The PLD framework formalizes user/system state transitions using tools from:
- Dynamical systems (phase manifolds, stability theorems)
- Algebraic structures (loop generators, repair operators)
- Topological constructs (winding numbers, loop separation)
- Metric geometry (phase distances, geodesics, fractals)

All models aim to **generate, classify, or visualize Pause/Drift/Loop structures** in a reusable form.

### 🌍 Multilingual Structure
While the core mathematical texts are in English, applications and guides are actively translated or localized into Japanese and other languages.  
See Notion UI packs for language-specific flows.
