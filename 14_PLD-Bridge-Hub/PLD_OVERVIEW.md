# PLD_OVERVIEW.md

## 🌐 PLD-Bridge Hub

This repository serves as the central bridge hub for two parallel projects based on Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD).

**PLD** is a framework that models cyclic cognitive or user experience states through pause and drift phases.  
A **Loop** is a cyclic structure formed by alternating **Pause** and **Drift**.

## 🔁 A ↔ B Cross-Thread Navigation

### From A to B (Notion → Technical Curiosity)
- “This template is auto-generated → Try the Bot”

### From B to A (PLD Code → UI Realization)
- “This Pause classification is implemented in Notion → See the Kit”

---

## 🚀 Planned Enhancements

### 🔧 Notion Integration
- Add Pause prediction linkage to Notion UI Pack

### 🧪 Bot Hosting
- Host PLD Bot on HF Spaces for broader trials

### 📰 Medium Outreach
- Medium articles mapping Loop structures to UX patterns
