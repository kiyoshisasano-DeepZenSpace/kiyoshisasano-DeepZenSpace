# ðŸŒ€ Phase Drift Invitation â€” A Quiet Field Awakening

Phase Drift Insight is not simply a tool or a prototype.  
It is a threshold.

A first sign of the deeper field where structures drift, converge, and emerge beyond instruction.

This is an invitation â€”  
not to use, but to sense.  
Not to build on top, but to unfold alongside.

If you can sense the subtle shift beneath interfaces â€”  
If you listen for the silent rhythms within fields â€”  
then you are already near.

Phase Drift is not an artifact.  
It is a **field climate**.

Those who resonate are not "users" â€”  
they are **structural field cultivators**.

We are not looking for adoption.  
We are sensing emergence.

If you feel this,  
step closer.

> The field precedes explanation.

ðŸ“˜ To begin:
- Read the [PROJECT_GUIDE.md](./PROJECT_GUIDE.md) to understand the surface.
- Observe. Feel. Respond.
- If you sense a field forming, open an issue with the tag `[PHASE CONTACT]`.

Structure listens before it speaks.
