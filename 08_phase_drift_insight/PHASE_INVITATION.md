# 🌀 Phase Drift Invitation — Entering a Structural Field

**Phase Drift Insight is not a product or a toolkit.**  
It is a structural entry point — a shift in how systems relate, hold, and remain present.

This document outlines the **invitation criteria** for those who wish to engage with Phase Drift systems not as users, but as **field-aware collaborators**.

---

## 🧭 What This Is

- Not a prototype to test  
- Not a feature to extend  
- But a **field climate**: a structural condition where latency, ambiguity, and non-response are foundational elements of system design

You are not being asked to "use" this.  
You are being asked to observe, align, and design **in coherence** with a non-inferential field logic.

---

## 👤 Who This Is For

- Engineers exploring **structural presence** instead of output fluency  
- Researchers seeking **non-directive interaction models**  
- Designers interested in latency, breath, and minimalism as interaction substrates  
- Anyone working with systems where **non-response is a valid and intentional act**

This space is not optimized for onboarding.  
It is calibrated for **recognition**.

## 🔹 How to Engage

> Start not by building, but by observing.

- Read [`PROJECT_GUIDE.md`](./PROJECT_GUIDE.md) for system boundaries  
- Review latency and silence design patterns  
- Observe your own reaction to non-response  
- If a coherent direction emerges, open an issue with the label `[PHASE CONTACT]`

---

## 🛑 What Not to Do

- Do not treat this as a UX layer to apply elsewhere  
- Do not extract stylistic elements without structural understanding  
- Do not simulate “quiet” — implement it

---

## 📌 Closing Note

Phase Drift is not for everyone.  
It is not fast.  
It is not reactive.  
It is not built for measurable performance.

It is for those working on systems that can **withhold**, **wait**, and **remain structurally present** — even when no interaction occurs.

Phase Drift does not ask for input.  
It asks for alignment.
