🌀 Phase Drift Insight  
Real-time Structural UX Research Toolkit  
**PoC-ready architecture for drift risk detection and latency-aware alignment.**  
Tracing latent phase drift beyond visible interaction.

📘 Project Overview  
Phase Drift Insight is a lightweight research platform  
designed to detect, record, and visualize Phase Drift —  
the subtle collapse and divergence of structural fields during user interaction.

We don't just track actions.  
We trace structural tension.


## 🔹 Key Features
- Phase Drift Detection (non-linear structural deviations)
- Real-time Phase Monitoring and Feedback Loop
- JSON + CSV Logging System
- Ultra-Lightweight, Local Deployment
- Real-time Drift Risk Visualization (WebSocket + Dynamic Dashboard)
- Drift Risk History Archive and Table View
- Future-ready architecture for Phase Drift Analytics

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3.11 + FastAPI (Backend API server)
- HTML + Vanilla JavaScript (Dynamic Frontend Dashboard)
- CSV/JSON for efficient phase and feedback record storage

## 🚀 How to Run
Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic
```

Start the server:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Then access:

- **API Documentation** : [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)
- **Real-time Risk Dashboard** : [http://127.0.0.1:8000/risk_dashboard](http://127.0.0.1:8000/risk_dashboard)
- **Drift Risk History Table** : [http://127.0.0.1:8000/risk_history](http://127.0.0.1:8000/risk_history)

## 📈 Roadmap (Planned)
