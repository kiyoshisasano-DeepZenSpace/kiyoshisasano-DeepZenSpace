# 🌀 Phase Drift Insight

*Real-time Structural UX Research Toolkit*  
*Tracing latent phase drift beyond visible interaction.*

---

## 📘 Project Overview

**Phase Drift Insight** is a lightweight research platform  
designed to detect, record, and visualize **Phase Drift** —  
the subtle collapse and divergence of structural fields during user interaction.

> We don't just track actions.  
> We trace **structural tension**.

---

## 🔹 Key Features

- Phase Drift Detection (non-linear structural deviations)
- Real-time Phase Monitoring and Feedback Loop
- JSON + CSV Logging System
- Ultra-Lightweight, Local Deployment
- Future-ready architecture for Phase Drift Analytics

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.11** + **FastAPI** (Backend API server)
- **HTML + Vanilla JavaScript** (Dynamic Frontend Dashboard)
- **CSV/JSON** for efficient phase and feedback record storage

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic
   ```

2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

3. Open API Docs:
   [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)

## 📈 Roadmap (Planned)

- Drift History Visualization and Analytics
- Phase Transition Mapping and Graphs
- WebSocket Live Updates
- SaaS Platform Integration for broader Phase Drift Management

> 🛠 **Note**:  
> This repository represents an experimental beta version.  
> It is intended for research and prototyping purposes.
