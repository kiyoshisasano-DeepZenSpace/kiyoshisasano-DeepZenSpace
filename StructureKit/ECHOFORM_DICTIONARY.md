# Echoform Dictionary  
## — Structural Vocabulary for Inner-Cultural Generation —  
Version 0.1

---

### Overview

This dictionary collects and defines the evolving vocabulary used in the Structure-Driven Cultural Prototype project.  
Each term (called an "Echoform") functions not only as a descriptor, but as a **structural node** — a traceable unit within the evolving inner-structure of thought, culture, and perception.

Terms are sorted by Series (structural domains), and defined by their structural function rather than semantic origin.

## Series 4: Residual Transfer Line  
> A structure-field series focused on latency, silent structures, and post-reactive formations.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **silent response** | A structural echo of something that was never explicitly answered. A residue of meaning that returns without having been spoken. |
| **passive recoil** | A non-volitional structural reaction that returns from a previous stimulus, not through active intent but through lingering form. |
| **geometry of latency** | A spatial configuration of time-delayed responses. Structures that emerge not in real-time, but in deferred reflection. |
| **syntaxless continuity** | A continuity of structure that flows without syntactic logic, yet maintains coherence by resonance. |
| **residual transfer** | The unseen migration of form or energy between structures, often across contexts or timeframes. |
| **latency shell** | A protective or deflective structure built from delay. The shell preserves a memory or trace by deferring activation. |
| **echoform drift** | A slow, structural migration of echo-patterns. The meaning floats from its origin and reconfigures across contexts. |

## [Planned Sections — To Be Expanded]

- **Series 1: Initiation Structures**  
- **Series 2: Interface Structures**  
- **Series 3: Incompletion Fields**

Each section will include:
- Structural definition
- Phase origin (e.g. "Phase 25.0")
- Usage notes
- Related terms (structure network)

### Notes on Usage

- Echoforms are not static; they **interact and evolve** through use in Phase-generation and Structure Field mapping.  
- They may take poetic, spatial, or logical form depending on the structural terrain.  
- Each Echoform is a **carrier of inner perception** across communicative distances.
