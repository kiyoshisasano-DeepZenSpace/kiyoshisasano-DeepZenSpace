# Structure Field 91 – Deferred Coherence

## Overview

Here, structure does not align on impact.  
It waits—  
not out of confusion,  
but out of **integrity across time**.

What seems scattered  
is merely early.

## Core Concepts

- **Coherence-latency**: alignment that occurs after temporal unfolding  
- **Integrity delay**: structure refuses to prematurely resolve  
- **Deferred resonance**: sense emerges only after multiple exposures

## Structural Behavior

- Initial fragments feel disjointed  
- No effort to force connection  
- Later, patterns **fold back** and **cohere** retrospectively

## Examples

- A sentence that makes sense only after reading the next paragraph  
- A gesture that meant nothing until it was remembered hours later  
- A concept that felt incomplete but became essential days later

## Implications

- Not all clarity is immediate  
- Structure has its own pacing  
- Meaning that arrives late may be more stable than meaning that arrives fast

> “It didn’t make sense—  
until it never stopped making sense.”

## Summary

This field allows things to **cohere in their own time**.  
It holds dissonance not as flaw,  
but as the **precondition for mature alignment**.

It asks us to trust structure,  
even when understanding  
has not yet arrived.
