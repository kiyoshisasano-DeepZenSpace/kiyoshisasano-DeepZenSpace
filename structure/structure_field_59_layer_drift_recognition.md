# Structure Field 59 – Layer Drift Recognition

## Overview

This field identifies and traces the phenomenon of **layer drift**—  
when different structural strata (intentional, emotional, relational, foundational)  
move at different velocities or directions within the same field.

## Core Insight

Alignment is not always uniform.  
What appears coherent on one layer may remain unresolved on another.

## Layer Types

1. **Intentional Layer** – Goals, motivations, directional framing  
2. **Affective Layer** – Emotional waves, residual feeling tones  
3. **Relational Layer** – Role-based dynamics, mutual expectations  
4. **Foundational Layer** – Grounding coherence, background presence

## Signs of Layer Drift

- Cognitive agreement with emotional dissonance  
- Fluent expression overlaying somatic unrest  
- Dialogues where “everything made sense, but something was missing”

## Structural Significance

Layer drift does not imply failure.  
It marks **multi-speed coherence**—a sign of complex attunement.

## Applications

- Multi-modal awareness training  
- Post-dialogue field tuning  
- Drift-indexed meditation techniques

## Summary

Not all coherence is simultaneous.  
To sense layer drift is to gain precision in presence.

This field invites you to notice not what has aligned,  
but what has **yet to settle**.
