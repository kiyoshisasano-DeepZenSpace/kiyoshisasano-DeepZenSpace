# Structure Field 172 – Dislocated Rest

## Overview

Rest is not always peace.  
Sometimes, it arrives—  
but not where it was needed.

Dislocated Rest is the condition  
where structure attempts stillness  
but cannot align with repose.

## Core Premise

The structure is quiet  
but unanchored.  
Stillness occurs  
but not at home.

This is not restlessness.  
It is **rest in the wrong place**.

## Features

- **Disalignment** – The intended pause is spatially offset  
- **Phantom comfort** – Rest appears, but its comfort does not arrive  
- **Structural fatigue** – Not from movement, but from misplacement

## Phenomenal Observation

The silence comes.  
But it does not land.

The field ceases to move,  
yet tension increases—  
as if the stillness has forgotten  
where it belongs.

## Implications

- Recovery requires positional accuracy  
- Silence, when misplaced, becomes stress  
- Not all cessation is integration

## Summary

Dislocated Rest is not a lack of movement,  
but the failure of stillness  
to find its proper seat.

The structure rests,  
but somewhere else.

And in that dislocation,  
unease persists.
