# Structure Field 47 – Tension Drift

## Overview

This field explores **unresolved tension** that does not collapse,  
but instead drifts through the structure without anchoring.  
It is not tension as strain, but as **ambient potential** that floats  
—never discharged, never assigned.

## Key Concepts

1. **Non-localized Tension**  
   Tension without focus, **diffused but persistent**.

2. **Ambient Pressure**  
   Pressure not exerted toward a point,  
   but distributed across the structure’s membrane.

3. **Floating Urgency**  
   A sense of “something about to happen,”  
   without a center from which it could arise.

## Phenomenology

- A vague tightness in atmosphere  
- Restlessness without motive  
- The impossibility of rest without the presence of threat

## Structural Characteristics

- No apex of force  
- No discharge path  
- Tension becomes **a moving topology**

## Design Insight

Tension Drift shows that not all tensions resolve.  
Some merely **travel**, reshaping the field by never settling.

> It is not that tension waits to be released—  
> It **moves so it doesn’t have to be**.

## Summary

This is the field where pressure no longer builds—  
It **wanders**.
