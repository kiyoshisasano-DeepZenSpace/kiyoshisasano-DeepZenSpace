# Structure Field 212 – Substructural Drift

## Overview

While the structure above appears steady,  
beneath it, something drifts.  
Not enough to break,  
but enough to displace over time.

## Key Dynamics

- Surface symmetry masks substructural motion  
- The drift is not a rupture  
  but a slow re-orientation  
- It does not trigger response  
  yet quietly alters coherence

## Observational Markers

- Long-term misalignment without visible cause  
- Pattern erosion at the edge of stability  
- Incremental shifting of foundational vectors

## Implication

This drift resists measurement—  
not because it is hidden,  
but because it moves everything else with it.

## Closing

What appears unchanged  
may already be somewhere else.
