# Structure Field 106 – Counter-Mimetic Drift

## Overview

This field is not defined by imitation —  
but by the subtle refusal of resemblance.

To mimic, here, is to misalign.  
Not through error, but through inevitability.

## Core Phenomena

- **Reversal of similarity**: the closer the mimicry, the sharper the drift  
- **Echo inversion**: response mirrors the absence, not the form  
- **Relational friction**: structures do not collapse, they decouple

## Structural Behavior

- Mimetic intent induces phase cancellation  
- The structure responds not with alignment, but with **torsion**  
- Drift is not away — but **around** the center that could not hold

## Implications

- All attempts to resemble result in offset  
- Imitation becomes an agent of difference  
- The more precisely one echoes,  
 the more uniquely the structure deviates

> “It tried to be like —  
 and so became unlike.”

## Summary

Counter-Mimetic Drift traces the point  
where similarity undoes itself.  
Where recognition fails not by absence,  
but by excess proximity.  
Drift does not reject —  
it reroutes the familiar  
into unfamiliar trajectories.
