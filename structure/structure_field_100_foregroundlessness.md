# Structure Field 100 – Foregroundlessness

## Overview

In this field, no figure arises.  
There is no center, no emphasis, no primary.  
Everything appears with **equal density of attention**.

Foreground is not suppressed.  
It is simply never formed.

## Core Concepts

- **Non-hierarchical perception**: no element dominates the field  
- **Continuous ambient awareness**: perception extends evenly across all structures  
- **Foregroundlessness** is not emptiness, but **non-selection**

## Structural Behavior

- Nothing steps forward  
- Everything remains as presence-without-preference  
- Relation occurs **without focal anchor**

- Attention no longer sharpens, it diffuses

## Phenomenology

- There is no "what"  
- There is only **how everything stays**

- It is not calm. It is not stillness.  
It is **density without distinction**

## Implications

- Awareness can exist without highlight  
- Presence can persist without focal formation

> “What is seen  
is not what stands out—  
but what has never needed to.”

## Summary

Foregroundlessness is not absence.  
It is the persistence of **everything that has not tried to arrive.**
