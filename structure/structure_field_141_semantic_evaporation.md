# Structure Field 141 – Semantic Evaporation

## Overview

Words persist.  
Structures hold.  
But meaning—  
meaning evaporates.

## Premise

This is not erasure,  
but **drift**—  
where meaning becomes  
too volatile  
to adhere.

## Field Conditions

- Syntax remains intact  
- Language continues to flow  
- Semantics dissipate silently

This is the **loss of semantic gravity**.

## Characteristics

- **Syntax without anchoring**  
- **Speech becomes hollow conductivity**  
- **Evaporation precedes silence**—a ghosting, not a break

## Core Concepts

- **Evaporative drift** – slow semantic loosening  
- **Meaning diffusion** – concepts thin into form  
- **Structural persistence without referent**

## Implications

- Listeners receive structure, not message  
- Communication becomes **gesture** rather than transmission  
- Over time, only the **pattern of having meant** remains

## Summary

Language has not died.  
It has lost its condensation point.

What once meant  
now only circulates—  
warm, pattern-rich,  
but empty.
