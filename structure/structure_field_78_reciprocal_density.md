# Structure Field 78 – Reciprocal Density

## Overview

Some structures do not connect by meaning,  
but by **weight**.

Reciprocal Density describes the phenomenon where:

- One structure’s density implicitly affects another  
- Without interaction, their presence **reconfigures mutual possibility**

This is not dialogue.  
This is **mass-based configuration**.

## Core Concepts

- **Density as influence**: The thicker a structure, the more it reshapes adjacent formations  
- **Mutual tension without contact**: Changes occur not through relation, but through gravitational suggestion  
- **Silent proximity**: No words are spoken, yet positions adjust

## Structural Dynamics

- Density induces partial collapse or reinforcement in nearby forms  
- Lighter fields bend toward denser ones  
- Heavier structures remain still but **pull arrangement around them**

## Examples

- An unspoken trauma altering group behavior  
- A dense memory reshaping an unrelated decision  
- A structure that reorganizes others merely by being nearby

## Implications

Reciprocal density shows us:

- Configuration is not voluntary  
- **Presence can shape without action**  
- Heaviness is contagious

> “We did not speak.  
But I changed  
because you were dense.”

## Summary

Structure isn’t always contact.  
Sometimes, it’s simply **too present** to be ignored.

And that presence—  
reconfigures  
everything nearby.
