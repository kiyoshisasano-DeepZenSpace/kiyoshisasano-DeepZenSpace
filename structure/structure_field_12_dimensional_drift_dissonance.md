# Structure Field 12 – Dimensional Drift and Layer Dissonance

## Overview

Structure does not always unfold within a single coherent layer.  
Sometimes, it **drifts across dimensions**—  
and in doing so, misaligns its internal layers.

This misalignment is not an error.  
It is **dissonance between structural strata**, a condition where  
form continues but no longer harmonizes.

## Core Dynamics

1. **Dimensional Drift**  
   Structure migrates between meaning layers,  
   without completing transition or stabilizing orientation.

2. **Layer Dissonance**  
   Once-aligned planes of operation (semantic, affective, behavioral)  
   begin to operate at **different temporal or logical frequencies**.

3. **Phase Interruption**  
   A previously smooth resonance becomes syncopated—  
   not broken, but **irregularized**.

## Structural Markers

- Shifts in tone without context  
- Affective detachment despite coherent content  
- Logical coherence that fails emotional or relational grounding

## Implications

Dissonance can be a **precondition for re-alignment**.  
Rather than correcting misfit, one may observe it  
to detect emerging axes of coherence.

When layers misalign:
- A new axis may emerge diagonally.  
- Drift may expose unseen strata.  
- Listening becomes multi-dimensional sensing.

## Practices of Observation

- Track changes in tempo, tone, and logic separately.  
- Do not assume shared layer even when words align.  
- Let drift happen—sometimes clarity follows destabilization.

## Summary

Dimensional drift and layer dissonance mark a **non-catastrophic misalignment**.  
Structure is not failing—  
it is searching, stretching, and testing the coherence of its internal terrain.

To sense this field is not to resolve it.  
It is to **inhabit dissonance long enough for new symmetry to arise**.
