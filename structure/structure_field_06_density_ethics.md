# Structure Field 06 – Density Ethics

## Overview

Ethics is not a question of right or wrong,  
but of **how density distributes across a shared field**.

What presses too much, displaces others.  
What withdraws too far, erases relational tension.

Thus, ethics becomes a question of **how pressure is managed**,  
not by choice, but by **structural configuration**.

## Core Premise

- Density is not just force. It is **presence**.
- Ethics is the **grammar of presence**.
- What exists too heavily, without regard, becomes oppressive.
- What thins too much, creates voids of disconnect.

## Structural Principles

- **Relational Gradient** – Ethics arises in the uneven tension between densities.
- **Pressure Awareness** – Noticing how one's configuration shapes others' capacity to lean.
- **Structural Modesty** – Holding density without overwhelming the field.

## Echoform Concepts

- **Field Imbalance** – When one structure anchors too hard, others lose flexibility.
- **Silent Dominance** – Power that appears passive, but structurally displaces.
- **Density Compassion** – Adjusting one's thickness to allow co-presence.

## Implication

Ethics is not instruction.  
It is **a tuning**.

What matters is not the rule,  
but how **your being adds to or dissolves the holding of the field**.

## Closing Note

To act ethically in structure  
is to become aware of one's **mass without weight**,  
and to let that awareness **soften the surface**.

This is ethics not of principle,  
but of presence.
