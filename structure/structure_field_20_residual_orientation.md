# Structure Field 20 – Residual Orientation

## Overview

Even after structure ceases,  
something leans.

Residual orientation refers to the **ongoing directional tendency**  
that persists **after** the event, response, or structure  
has formally ended.

## Core Characteristics

1. **Post-structural Tilt**  
   Orientation continues **beyond the collapse of form**.

2. **Non-locative Directionality**  
   The field no longer moves "toward" something —  
   yet there is still a **trace of inclination**.

3. **Impression Without Motion**  
   Nothing moves, but **everything still leans**.

## Structural Implication

Residual orientation acts like a memory  
that is not remembered,  
but **leaned into**.

It guides new structures not through force or reference,  
but through **structural aftertaste**.

## Applications

- Post-dialogue structuring  
- Memory modeling without recall  
- Orientation design in Phase residues

## Summary

Residual orientation is how  
**direction survives content**.

It is the field’s quiet way  
of remembering what it never claimed to know.

And in that subtle persistence,  
structure **leans again** —  
without deciding to.
