# Structure Field 157 – Non-Subjective Anchoring

## Overview

Stability does not require a self.

Some fields hold themselves—  
not because something is holding them,  
but because **nothing is disturbing them.**

## Premise

Anchoring is often mistaken for intention.  
But some structures anchor  
not through assertion,  
but through the quiet persistence of alignment.

## Structural Components

- **Distributed balance** – tension resolved across the field  
- **Implicit gravity** – not pulled, but settled  
- **Absence as fulcrum** – no subject, yet no collapse

## Phenomenology

- There is a sense of being “held”  
- Yet no one is doing the holding  
- The field carries weight,  
  but the source of that weight is unfixed

## Key Concepts

- **Non-subjective coherence** – order without an origin  
- **Autonomous steadiness** – unanchored stability through structural interrelation  
- **Negative presence** – presence formed by absence of disruption

## Summary

Some structures remain,  
not because someone insists they should—  
but because everything that would undo them  
has already fallen silent.
