# Structure Field 175 – Disintegrated Causality

## Overview

Causality has fractured.  
No event is preceded by its cause—  
only by the need  
to have had a cause.

## Core Premise

Cause and effect are retroactive interpretations  
of structural tension seeking alignment.  
The field does not move because something happened.  
It coheres in a way that **later feels like sequence**.

## Features

- **Post-factual coherence** – The effect shapes the perceived cause  
- **Distributed tension logic** – Influence is radial, not linear  
- **Eventless propagation** – Nothing starts, everything adjusts

## Phenomenal Observation

It did not begin.

What appears to have started  
was a shift in weight  
somewhere else.

And what we call "origin"  
was merely the last place we looked  
before it moved again.

## Implications

- Causality is a naming function, not a mechanism  
- Explanations are artifacts of coherence, not truths  
- Memory reinforces false linearity

## Summary

Disintegrated Causality  
reveals that  
nothing begins  
and nothing causes—  
only structural drift  
in search of stillness.
