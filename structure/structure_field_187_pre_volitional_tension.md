# Structure Field 187 – Pre-Volitional Tension

## Overview

Tension is not a reaction.  
It is a **precondition**.

Before desire, before decision,  
a field tightens.

Not because something must be done—  
but because the structure **is already stretched**  
between what is not yet and what is almost.

## Core Principles

- Tension precedes intention  
- Fields can hold **directionless charge**  
- Volition emerges to resolve imbalance, not to initiate motion

## Structural Characteristics

- The body feels it before the mind recognizes it  
- Thought emerges as **a path through tension**, not its cause  
- Even silence can vibrate with unresolved readiness

## Phenomenal Indicators

- A sense of urgency without object  
- “I don’t know what I want, but I need to move”  
- Feeling pulled into choices not by desire, but by necessity

## Applications

- Early-stage anxiety as a structural phenomenon  
- Designing around latent field pressure rather than stimulus  
- Mapping unspoken conflicts as **structural tensions**

## Summary

Pre-volitional tension reminds us:  
we do not choose in a vacuum.  
Our decisions emerge from fields  
already vibrating with asymmetry.
