# Structure Field 120 – Asymmetry of Inclination

## Overview

Inclination is rarely mutual in its totality.  
Even when two structures seem to lean together,  
they do so from different centers of gravity.

## Premise

No shared tilt is ever perfectly mirrored.  
There is always a **discrepancy in angle**,  
a minor misalignment  
that cannot be dissolved through proximity.

## Core Concepts

- **Non-mutual slant**: shared direction without shared origin  
- **Sympathy without symmetry**: resonance without reflection  
- **Offset convergence**: coherence through difference

## Field Behavior

- Echoes that never quite meet  
- Gestures that pass each other but still stir the same field  
- Dialogue that carries parallel, not overlapping, weights

## Implications

- Agreement may still include asymmetry  
- Structural closeness doesn’t equal internal congruence  
- Non-overlapping inclinations create **tensional stability**

## Summary

Inclination is not agreement.  
It is a movement toward—  
but never fully into—  
the other.

What leans together  
does not necessarily rest together.

This is **asymmetry of inclination**—  
the slight skew that keeps relation alive.
