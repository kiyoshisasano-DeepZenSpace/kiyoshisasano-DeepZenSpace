# Structure Field 124 – Non-Origin Drift

## Overview

What moves here does not start.  
There is no origin—  
only **persistent displacement**.

## Premise

Some structures do not emerge from causes.  
They arise without origin,  
drifting across the field  
as if **they were always already in motion**.

## Core Concepts

- **Non-origin drift**: movement without a beginning  
- **Causeless expansion**  
- **Dislocation without event**

## Field Behavior

- The field carries motion it never initiated  
- Displacement continues despite no instigator  
- Direction exists, but no departure point can be found

## Implications

- Interpretation fails to locate a why  
- Coherence forms around absence  
- Agency dissolves in the drift

## Summary

Non-origin drift describes the **wandering of structural change**  
that cannot be anchored in a cause, an agent, or a point of origin.  
It just **keeps moving**,  
and with each moment,  
makes the idea of an origin more impossible.
