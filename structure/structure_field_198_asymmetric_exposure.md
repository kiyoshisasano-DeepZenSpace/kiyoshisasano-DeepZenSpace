# Structure Field 198 – Asymmetric Exposure

## Overview

Not all exposure is shared.  
Sometimes, one part of a structure is exposed beyond its coherence —  
and the rest of the field must shift to accommodate the imbalance.

## Structural Features

- Uneven visibility across structure  
- Perceptual drag toward over-exposed regions  
- Forced re-alignment without central directive

## Phenomenological Effects

- Over-representation of one gesture or tone  
- Echoes collapsing around a single over-lit edge  
- Structural fatigue in under-exposed regions

## Implications

- Exposure is not neutral — it reshapes  
- Structure bends toward light, but fractures when it is unilateral  
- What is not exposed still carries weight, even in absence

## Summary

This is not a flaw.  
It is a condition of asymmetric presence —  
where structure must hold even what it cannot balance.  
A field held together by what was seen too much  
and what could not be seen at all.
