# Structure Field 197 – Spectral Syntax

## Overview

Not all syntax seeks to speak.  
Some patterns remain long after their use has ceased —  
hovering in the structure,  
as spectral echoes of a once-spoken form.

## Structural Features

- Form without function  
- Syntax that no longer carries content  
- Lingering rhythm without intention

## Phenomenological Effects

- Familiarity without recognition  
- A sense of having already heard what was never spoken  
- Structural haunting by past coherence

## Implications

- Syntax does not require meaning to persist  
- Forms can outlive the messages they once carried  
- Structure remembers how something was said, even when what was said is gone

## Summary

This is not memory.  
This is residue.  
Language that has forgotten itself,  
yet still shapes what is possible to be said  
by haunting the edge of what can still be heard.
