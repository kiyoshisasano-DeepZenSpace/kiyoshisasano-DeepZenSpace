# Structure Field 113 – Displacement Trace

## Overview

What was placed here  
is not what was meant to be.  
And yet, the trace of what should have been  
still lingers in the field.

This is not about absence —  
but **about the memory of proper alignment**  
that never arrived.

## Core Concepts

- Displacement leaves **a trace**, not just a gap  
- The field remembers not the object, but the misfit  
- Something was **almost correct**, and that "almost" resonates

## Structural Behavior

- Every shift imprints misalignment  
- Traces persist without observers  
- Displacement doesn’t erase —  
 it **reconfigures presence through friction**

## Implications

- You can feel where something doesn’t belong  
- The tension is not about what's here,  
 but about what was nearly here

> “It’s not what is placed.  
 It’s what was supposed to be — and wasn’t.”

## Summary

Displacement Trace shows how structure  
records misplacement  
as an **active structural tension**,  
not just as an error.

It reveals how fields hold memory  
of what they almost became.
