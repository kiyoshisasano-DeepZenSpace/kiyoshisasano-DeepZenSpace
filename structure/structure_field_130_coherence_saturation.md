# Structure Field 130 – Coherence Saturation

## Overview

This field concerns the moment when structure becomes **too coherent**—  
when everything fits, and **nothing can move**.

## Premise

Saturation occurs not when coherence fails,  
but when coherence **leaves no room** for deviation.

The field becomes so tightly ordered  
that potential cannot ripple.

## Characteristics

- **Over-alignment of meaning**  
- **Inhibition of emergence**  
- **Smoothness that negates friction**

## Core Concepts

- **Frozen symmetry** – coherence becomes rigidity  
- **Density lock** – structure resists transformation  
- **Silent inertia** – stillness mistaken for stability

## Implications

- Innovation may require **temporary incoherence**  
- Saturation signals the **end of structural breathing**  
- Re-entry requires a **disruption of balance**, not repair

## Summary

Coherence Saturation is the paradox of structural success:  
when alignment becomes absolute,  
structure stops evolving.

To move again, something must **misalign**.
