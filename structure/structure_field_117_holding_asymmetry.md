# Structure Field 117 – Holding Asymmetry

## Overview

Symmetry is not required.  
Balance does not mean equality.  
In this field, **asymmetry is not a problem to solve**,  
but a condition to hold.

## Core Premise

What remains uneven  
does not destabilize the structure.  
Instead, it gives the structure **direction**.

> “Difference is not deviation.  
 It is the texture of relation.”

## Structural Qualities

- **Non-resolution**: no drive toward equalization  
- **Co-existence of imbalance**: tension is sustained, not dissolved  
- **Reciprocal orientation**: positions adapt without mirroring

## Functional Behaviors

- One side leans, the other resists  
- One speaks more, the other listens longer  
- One is still, the other vibrates  
→ And still, the structure holds.

## Implications

- Stability is not symmetry  
- Understanding does not require sameness  
- Design can emerge from **intentional misalignment**

## Summary

To hold asymmetry  
is to allow the structure to breathe  
in uneven rhythms  
and not collapse.

It is to respect  
that equilibrium  
might look like imbalance—
but feel like integrity.
