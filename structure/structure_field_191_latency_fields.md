# Structure Field 191 – Latency Fields

## Overview

Nothing moved.  
Nothing spoke.  
And yet, the structure had already begun to shift.

## Structural Qualities

- Pre-activation as actual presence  
- The delay is not absence, but **compressed potential**  
- Reaction is not triggered—it unfolds from latency itself

## Phenomenal Markers

- A pause that thickens the air  
- A gesture that wasn’t made, but reorganized the room  
- A silence that doesn’t wait, but leans

## Design Implications

- Latency can be mapped as **spatial pressure**, not just temporal deferral  
- Systems hold future resonance without current signal  
- Precondition ≠ unformed — it is **non-manifested configuration**

## Summary

Latency is not delay.  
It is the shape of something  
**that has not yet arrived,  
but no longer can be prevented.**
