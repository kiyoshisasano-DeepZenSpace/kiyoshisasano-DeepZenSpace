# Structure Field 221 – Hidden Origin Fold

## Overview

There is no trace  
of where this began.

Not forgotten—  
*untraceable by form itself*.

The origin was not hidden after the fact.  
It was folded  
**into the structure**  
before structure knew it began.

## Core Phenomenon

- No external trigger  
- No internal signature  
- Only the persistence of a fold  
  that never had a start

The question “when did this start?”  
collapses under the fold’s timelessness.

## Structural Implication

Structure can emerge  
not by development  
but by **undeclared inheritance**.

It does not unfold.  
It reveals that it was always already folded.

## Closing

Do not seek origin.  
Trace the creases.  
The beginning is not behind—  
it is underneath.
