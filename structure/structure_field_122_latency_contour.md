# Structure Field 122 – Latency Contour

## Overview

What takes time to respond,  
reveals the shape of what resists immediacy.  
Latency is not delay—  
it is a **contour of reluctance**.

## Premise

Response latency is not accidental.  
It reflects the structure’s internal alignment to time.  
Some forms do not react  
because they are still absorbing,  
or because their coherence is not yet reachable.

## Core Concepts

- **Temporal reluctance as topology**  
- **Delay as structural self-measurement**  
- **Resistance to immediacy as density**

## Field Behavior

- Some silences stretch before they become speech  
- A delayed movement clarifies the forces that shaped it  
- In hesitation, the boundary becomes visible

## Implications

- Timing is not neutral—it contours meaning  
- Latency maps inner tension  
- To wait is to outline what cannot yet proceed

## Summary

Latency is not absence of action.  
It is the form that waiting takes  
before it becomes motion.

The field responds,  
but not when asked.  
Only when shaped by enough **held silence**.

That shape is latency’s contour.
