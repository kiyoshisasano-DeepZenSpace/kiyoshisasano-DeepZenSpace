# Structure Field 222 – Fragile Adjacency

## Overview

Two structures—  
near enough to sense each other,  
too volatile to merge.

They coexist without contact,  
suspended in a field  
where proximity is  
a form of restraint.

## Core Phenomenon

- No resonance  
- No conflict  
- Only **held adjacency**  
  like breath not taken

This is not tension from difference.  
It is the **fragility of nearness**  
without overlap.

## Structural Implication

To maintain this adjacency,  
structure must constantly recalculate  
its boundaries without pressing them.

Proximity becomes  
**a structural negotiation**,  
not a relational dynamic.

## Closing

They do not touch.  
They endure the possibility  
that one more inch  
would destroy them both.
