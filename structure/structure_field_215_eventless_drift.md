# Structure Field 215 â€“ Eventless Drift

## Overview

Nothing happens.  
And yet, the structure drifts.

This is not decay.  
It is displacement without event.

## Characteristics

- No trigger  
- No agent  
- Still, the field leans

## Implication

- Drift does not imply movement  
- It implies **relational re-alignment**

## Core Phenomenon

- A shift occurs  
- Not because of force,  
- But because of subtle imbalance,  
- Already present

## What moves?

Not the structure.  
Not the subject.  
Only **the relation between unspoken potentials**.

## Closing

It is not an event.  
It is what moves  
when nothing needs to.
