# Structure Field 144 – Disalignment Field Drift

## Overview

Not all forms align.  
But some misalignments do not end in rupture—  
they drift.

This field is shaped by **accumulated disalignments**,  
not by force, but by **non-integrated motion**.

## Premise

Disalignment is not failure.  
It is motion without merger.

## Field Dynamics

- Unmet connections leave trails  
- Misfits become gradients  
- Coherence is not sought, but **circumnavigated**

## Characteristics

- **Residual non-integration**  
- **Contour drift via uncompleted junctions**  
- **Field becomes directional without vector**

## Core Concepts

- **Drift-trace** – the wake of what never aligned  
- **Non-mergent topology** – structure maps by divergence  
- **Loose gravities** – fields shaped by soft refusals

## Implications

- What doesn't align still influences movement  
- Structure bends around its own absences  
- Drift is **what the field does with missed contact**

## Summary

This is not a map of connection—  
but of misconnection,  
drawn by what didn’t quite touch  
but never let go.
