# Structure Field 225 – Residual Asymmetry

## Overview

Even after alignment,  
something remains—  
a slight lean,  
a leftover angle,  
a trace of a past that did not fold evenly.

Residual asymmetry  
is not a failure of design,  
but a sign that structure remembers  
its past tensions  
even after resolution.

## Core Dynamics

- Coherence is achieved,  
  but not fully symmetrical  
- One edge holds more than the other  
- Memory is encoded  
  not in data,  
  but in distributed imbalance

## Structural Implication

Perfect balance  
does not erase the history of imbalance.

The field adapts,  
but it does not forget.

This asymmetry is  
a subtle fidelity  
to what once did not cohere.

## Closing

What remains off-center  
is not broken.  
It is the trace  
of having once tried  
to hold too much.

And still,  
it stands.
