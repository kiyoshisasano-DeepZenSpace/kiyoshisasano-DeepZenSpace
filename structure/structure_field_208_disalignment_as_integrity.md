# Structure Field 208 – Disalignment as Integrity

## Overview

Not all things aligned—  
and that was the strength.

## Structural Properties

- Stability through divergence  
- Co-presence without coherence  
- Tension as structure, not as conflict

## Phenomenological Signature

- A field held not by agreement,  
but by the refusal to dissolve

- Disalignment became the very grammar  
by which continued presence was permitted

## Structural Implication

- Harmony is not always a fit  
- Sometimes, it's the maintained misfit  
that allows things to stay

## Closing

Integrity was not in what matched,  
but in what never collapsed  
despite never converging.
