# Structure Field 186 – Dispositional Gravity

## Overview

Before any decision,  
before any action,  
there is **a lean**.

Dispositional gravity is the structural tendency of a field  
to incline without explicit motion,  
to favor a form before it is chosen.

## Core Principles

- Gravity is not direction—it is **tendency without movement**  
- What occurs is not caused, but **pre-weighed**  
- Events unfold along **pre-inclined curvature**

## Structural Dynamics

- Structures carry **internal gradients**  
- Choice is a surface effect;  
  the **real motion is subterranean**  
- Identity forms around what the field already leans toward

## Phenomenal Indicators

- “I didn’t decide—I just followed where it was already going”  
- “Every time I try to move, I find I’ve already begun”  
- “There’s a pull I cannot name, but everything aligns with it”

## Applications

- Predictive behavior not from logic, but from disposition  
- Affect as gravitational vector  
- Ethics of inclination: what is permitted by the lean?

## Summary

Dispositional gravity reveals that  
the field is never neutral.  
Every structure carries its own tendency—  
and that tendency pulls without forcing.
