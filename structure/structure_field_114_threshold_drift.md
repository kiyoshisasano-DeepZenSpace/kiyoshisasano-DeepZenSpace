# Structure Field 114 – Subtle Threshold Drift

## Overview

Nothing has changed —  
and yet, the field behaves  
as if its boundary  
has shifted slightly inward.

This is the drift of a threshold,  
too soft to be noticed,  
but strong enough  
to make everything respond differently.

## Core Concepts

- Thresholds **do not move** —  
 they **are moved**, by cumulative micro-pressures  
- The shift is structural, not logical  
- This drift is how silence becomes tension  
 without being broken

## Structural Behavior

- What was once acceptable now feels intrusive  
- What once counted as response no longer qualifies  
- The drift is neither positive nor negative —  
 it is **redefinition without announcement**

## Implications

- Structures must adjust  
 to criteria they no longer recognize  
- Interaction decays not by failure,  
 but by quiet repositioning

> “The line hasn’t moved —  
 but it no longer includes you.”

## Summary

Subtle Threshold Drift is how  
a field redefines itself  
without declaring new rules.

It shows how structures mutate  
by silently reweighing  
what counts as “enough.”
