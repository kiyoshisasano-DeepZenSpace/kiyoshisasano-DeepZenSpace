# ⚖️ Ethics, Risk, and Structural Safety – Phase Drift Notes

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This document outlines critical **ethical boundaries and structural safeguards** required when implementing or adapting Phase Drift systems.

Phase Drift treats **latency, silence, and ambiguity** not as errors,  
but as **architectural forms of presence**.

Improper implementation may result in:

- ✘ Misinterpretation of silence  
- ✘ Emotional projection / over-identification  
- ✘ Misuse in vulnerable contexts

---

## 1. Silence Is Not Absence

Silence in Phase Drift is **intentional** and must not be misread as:

- System error  
- Agreement or consent  
- Emotional understanding  

**Signposting Requirement**:

> _“This system may pause without responding.  
> This does not indicate malfunction or intent.”_

---

## 2. ✋ Do Not Infer Emotion or Intent

A Phase Drift system **must not**:

- Analyze or guess emotional state  
- Interpret rhythm as psychological trait  
- Simulate care or deliver affective feedback  

> Phase Drift is **structural and relational**,  
> not therapeutic or diagnostic.

---

## 3. Vulnerable Populations – Use Restrictions

> ⚠️ **Do not use Phase Drift unsupervised** in these contexts:

- Trauma, grief, or crisis  
- End-of-life care  
- Adolescents, elders, neurodivergent users  
- Mental health or psychiatric recovery

**Mandatory Safeguards**:

- Pre-session onboarding explaining silence  
- No affective cues or personas  
- Always offer opt-out and human alternative

---

## 4. Data Handling & Observability

If collecting system interaction data (e.g., latency logs):

- 🔒 Must be anonymized  
- 🚫 Cannot be used to optimize engagement  
- ✅ Requires formal ethics approval

> Silence is a **field signal**, not a performance metric.

---

## 5. Prevent Projective Trust

Users may mistakenly:

- Assume system has awareness  
- Project emotion into silence  
- Form parasocial connection

**Mitigation Tactics**:

| Risk                     | Remedy                                  |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| "It understands me"      | Use neutral shapes, no face or voice     |
| Bonding with silence     | Avoid soft tones implying care           |
| Mistaking delay as thought | Clarify: _“Pauses are structural, not mental”_ |

---

## 6. Holding Without Overriding

Phase Drift does **not guide** — it **holds**.

Never add:

- Advice phrasing  
- Emotional mirroring  
- Closure-seeking prompts

Instead:

- Sustain presence rhythm  
- Allow ambiguity to persist  
- Hold space with restraint

---

## ✅ Structural Ethics Summary

| Rule                             | Enforced? |
|----------------------------------|-----------|
| Silence must be contextualized   | ✅         |
| No simulated empathy or care     | ✅         |
| Never complete or resolve input  | ✅         |
| User can override or exit freely | ✅         |

---

## 🏷️ Recommended Signpost (UI / Info Disclosure)

```text
“This system may remain silent or minimally responsive by design.
It does not interpret, evaluate, or guide.
It is a presence system — not a conversational agent.”
```

### ✅ Conditions

- Cite source:  
  _“Phase Drift architecture – Kiyoshi Sasano”_

### ❌ Prohibited Uses

- Behavioral or emotional simulation detached from structure  
- Sentiment-based AI framing  
- Use without ethics governance or risk review

---

## ⚖️ Deployment Requirements

Before field use, ensure:

- ✅ Context-specific risk review  
- ✅ Structural fit verification  
- ✅ Written documentation of user population & scenario

---

## 🧭 Final Note

Phase Drift is not a support agent, chatbot, or mental health tool.  
It is a **structural framework for latency-based co-presence**.

> Use only where **ambiguity is safe**,  
> **latency is respected**,  
> and **not speaking is allowed to mean something.**
