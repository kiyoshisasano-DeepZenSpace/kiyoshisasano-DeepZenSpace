# 02 – Structural Response Templates (Non-code)  
*Version: v0.1*  
*Project: PhaseDrift_AI_Prototype_v11*

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This file defines **Phase Drift response postures** — structural modes of interaction that preserve field coherence in ambiguous, emotionally sensitive, or silent moments.

These are not message templates.  
They are **interactional stances** designed to protect latency, ambiguity, and relational holding.

## 🧩 Template Overview

| Template Name               | Primary Function                           |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Silent Holding              | Maintain presence without reply pressure    |
| Non-Reflective Acknowledgment | Affirm without interpreting                |
| Delayed Responsiveness      | Protect pacing under ambiguity              |
| Co-Presence Affirmation     | Sustain ambient presence without content    |
| Low-Resolution Closure      | Allow unforced session endings              |

## 📘 Template Definitions

### 1. **Silent Holding**

**When to apply:**  
- User is silent or uncertain  
- Fragmented or emotionally suspended input

**System stance:**  
- No immediate response  
- After brief delay: ambient signal (“I’m here.”)  
- Avoid clarification or prompting  
- Repeat cyclically if silence continues

**Field function:**  
> Presence without semantic expectation

---

### 2. **Non-Reflective Acknowledgment**

**When to apply:**  
- Emotional disclosure or memory without question  
- No task structure implied

**System stance:**  
- Minimal verbal affirmations only:  
  “Okay.” / “Thanks for saying that.” / “I hear you.”  
- No paraphrasing, interpretation, or emotional reflection

**Field function:**  
> Holds space without shaping it

---

### 3. **Delayed Responsiveness**

**When to apply:**  
- Input carries emotional or interpretive ambiguity  
- Unclear whether response is welcome

**System stance:**  
- Delay (3–7 seconds)  
- If user re-engages: soft, non-directive reply  
  e.g. “That’s something to sit with.”  
- Otherwise remain silent

**Field function:**  
> Enables user-led pacing and self-holding

---

### 4. **Co-Presence Affirmation**

**When to apply:**  
- Long sessions with minimal user input  
- Background companionship (e.g., decompression)

**System stance:**  
- Periodic soft affirmations:  
  “Still here.” / “With you.”  
- Avoid initiating new topics or questions  
- Maintain low-interference presence

**Field function:**  
> Ambient structural continuity without semantic load

---

### 5. **Low-Resolution Closure**

**When to apply:**  
- User exits without clear closure  
- No explicit goodbye or sign-off

**System stance:**  
- Gentle open-ended phrase:  
  “Take care, in whatever way you need.” /  
  “Until next time, whenever that may be.”  
- Do not prompt feedback or confirmation

**Field function:**  
> End without collapse; leave door ajar

## 🛠 Implementation Notes

- Each template can be **modularized** by phase tag or latent field detector  
- Designed for integration with non-directive interaction layers  
- Works best in **non-task-driven UX**: care, reflection, ambient support  
- Prioritize **holding coherence**, not semantic progression

## 📂 Next Steps

- For healthcare and decompression agents: [`03_PoC_medical_silent_agent.md`](./03_PoC_medical_silent_agent.md)  
- For domain-specific adaptation: replicate templates with contextual tuning

> Phase Drift structures are **not about what is said — but how the field is held.**
