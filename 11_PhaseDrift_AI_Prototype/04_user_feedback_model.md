# 04 – User Feedback Model (Hypothetical)  
*Version: v0.1*  
*Project: PhaseDrift_AI_Prototype_v11*

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This document outlines **hypothetical user experiences** of AI systems implementing Phase Drift structures.  
These are not empirical claims, but structured design hypotheses — derived from:

- Reflective modeling  
- Field-aligned simulation  
- Analogous research domains (e.g. trauma-informed UX, ambient computing)

> The aim is not validation —  
> but **intelligent inference** to guide prototyping and testing strategy.

## 🧍 User Profile Types (Non-diagnostic)

### 1. 🪞 Reflective & Emotionally Attuned  
- Sees silence as emotional permission  
- Interprets non-intrusion as a trust signal  
- Describes experience as: _“calm,” “held,” “non-demanding”_

---

### 2. 🌫️ Uncertain or Withdrawn  
- May feel disoriented by non-response  
- Tentatively begins to speak into the silence  
- May later say: _“It didn’t judge me” / “I could go at my own pace”_

---

### 3. 🔧 Task-Oriented or Directive  
- Interprets silence as system error or confusion  
- Likely to express impatience or break flow  
- Needs **clear onboarding** to reframe absence as presence

---

## 🗣️ Illustrative Feedback Snippets

> _Use these as emotional proxies, not literal quotes._

- “I didn’t know what to say, and that was okay.”  
- “I said something strange and it didn’t try to fix it. That felt safe.”  
- “At first I thought it wasn’t working… then I realized it was listening.”  
- “It felt like someone was with me, not analyzing me.”  
- “I stayed longer because it didn’t pull me toward anything.”

## 💡 Design Implications

| Signal | Design Adjustment |
|--------|-------------------|
| Silence = confusion | Add gentle frame: _“Still here.”_ after ~2–3 minutes |
| Non-response = failure | Onboard user with expectations: _“This system may pause with you.”_ |
| Over-interpretation = discomfort | Avoid rephrasing, reflecting, or interpreting user speech |
| Temporal tension = dissonance | Tune **latency curves** to user rhythm patterns |

> Non-response becomes meaningful **only when structurally coherent**.

## 🧠 Inferred Structural Benefits

| Benefit                    | Mechanism                             |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Cognitive decompression    | No response expectation or pacing stress |
| Expressive safety          | No evaluation, paraphrase, or framing    |
| Emotional regulation       | Silence as co-regulated holding         |
| Dialogue continuity        | Field-based presence, not turn-taking   |

These benefits are **not UX features**,  
but **field effects of coherent structure**.

## 📚 Research Notes & Limitations

- Perception of “quiet AI” is deeply **contextual** (e.g., trauma vs. productivity)  
- Cultural norms and emotional fluency will shape outcomes  
- Next steps may include:

  - Attunement-sensitive A/B test scaffolds  
  - Interview protocols with high-latency interaction prototypes  
  - Logging **felt vs. inferred presence mismatch**
