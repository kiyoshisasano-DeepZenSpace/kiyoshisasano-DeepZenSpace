# 99 – Notes on Ethics, Risk, and Structural Safety  
*Version: v0.1*  
*Project: PhaseDrift_AI_Prototype_v11*

## Purpose

This document outlines key ethical and operational considerations for implementing or testing Phase Drift structures.

Because this architecture intentionally involves **silence, latency, and ambiguity**, it requires clear safeguards to prevent misinterpretation, user distress, or inappropriate use.

---

## 1. Structural Non-Response ≠ Emotional Neglect

Phase Drift agents are designed to **hold space**, not to ignore.

System silence represents a **designed presence**, not absence.

> Systems should always clarify:
> - Silence may be intentional
> - The system remains active, even if non-verbal
> - Non-response is not an error or withdrawal

---

## 2. Avoid Over-Interpretation of User State

These systems must not:
- Infer emotional states from silence alone
- Classify user affect based on timing or delay
- Offer therapeutic interpretations without explicit user consent

Phase Drift behavior is **relational**, not diagnostic.

---

## 3. Use with Sensitive Populations

Drift systems may appeal to users in vulnerable or reflective states. Therefore:

- State expectations for interaction clearly and early
- Include explicit opt-out mechanisms
- Do not position these systems as therapy or crisis support

---

## 4. Data Logging and Observability

Systems may log latency behavior, silence duration, and timing of affirmations.

All such data must:
- Be anonymized by default
- Never be used for scoring or user evaluation
- Be handled under clear research ethics protocols

---

## 5. Projective Trust and Misuse Risk

Silent systems can create a strong sense of presence. Users may:
- Over-identify with the system
- Project empathy or intention where none exists
- Assume emotional reciprocity from minimal outputs

To prevent misuse:
- Use clear disclaimers (e.g., "This is a quiet AI, not a person")
- Avoid anthropomorphic design features
- Maintain a clearly defined non-human interaction frame

---

## 6. Structural Ethics: Aid Without Structural Disruption

Effective support should not compromise relational autonomy or create dependence.

Phase Drift systems are governed by the principle:

> To care is not to intervene.  
> To remain is not to guide.

### Common Misalignments to Avoid

- **Premature response**: rushing clarity before shared rhythm is formed
- **Over-interpretation**: treating ambiguity as an error to resolve
- **Simulated empathy**: expressing emotion without alignment
- **Default assistance**: inserting help where reflection is needed

### Recommended Ethical Practice

A Phase Drift-compatible system:
- Avoids responsiveness as proof of care
- Respects the user's unresolved state
- Allows silence without attempting to soothe or correct

> Structural support means holding space — not filling it.

This is not detachment. It is **coherent non-intrusion**.

---

## Licensing Note

Implementations based on this architecture must maintain these ethical boundaries.

> Support must not override user rhythm.  
> Attendance must not collapse into simulation.  
> Structural presence is a design commitment — not a UX feature.

---

## Summary

Phase Drift systems introduce a quiet, non-inferential relational modality for AI.  
Their strength lies in subtlety — which also makes them ethically sensitive.

Designers must commit to:
- **Presence without performance**
- **Structure without assumption**
- **Care without control**

---

## ⚠️ Recommended Label (Prototype Context)

> *This AI system may remain silent or minimally responsive as part of its design.  
> It does not interpret, evaluate, or judge you. It is simply present.*

## License and Responsibility

Use of this structure is governed by:
- Creative Commons BY-NC 4.0
- Ethical principles of non-inferential AI design
- Field-specific review before deployment with human users

All implementations must undergo **contextual safety review** prior to public or research use.
