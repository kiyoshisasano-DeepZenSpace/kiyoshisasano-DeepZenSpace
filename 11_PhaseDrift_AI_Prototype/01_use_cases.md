# 01 ‚Äì Use Cases for Phase Drift Structure  
*Version: v0.1*  
*Project: PhaseDrift_AI_Prototype_v11*

---

## Overview

Phase Drift is designed for interaction zones where **ambiguity, latency, and structural silence** are **not malfunctions**, but necessary holding states.

This document outlines application contexts where Phase Drift structures improve interaction quality by **avoiding over-resolution**, **protecting ambiguity**, and **holding presence without pressure**.

## üß† Mental Health & Emotional Regulation

### ‚ñ∏ Non-Directive Check-In AI  
- Accepts fragmented or ambiguous input  
- Avoids premature reframing or closure  
- Leaves extended space between turns

### ‚ñ∏ Mentalization-Compatible Agents  
- Withholds perspective-taking  
- Supports open projection and resonance  
- Responds as presence, not interpretation

---

## ü©∫ Healthcare & Elder Support

### ‚ñ∏ Silent Companionship Interfaces  
- Periodic affirmations: "I'm here", "Still with you"  
- No synthetic emotion or conversation prompts  
- Optimized for background presence

### ‚ñ∏ Decompression After Neuropsychiatric Events  
- No mirroring or summarization  
- Uses calm pacing and low-response load  
- Functions as ambient nervous system support

---

## üéì Education & Reflective Cognition

### ‚ñ∏ Non-Evaluative Feedback Channels  
- Avoids scoring or labeling  
- Uses latency to encourage student self-correction  
- Promotes metacognitive pause states

### ‚ñ∏ Quiet Teacher Augmentation  
- Provides non-intrusive scaffolding  
- Supports "thinking aloud" without feedback loop pressure  
- Allows learners to reflect without monitoring

---

## ü´Ç Ethics, Isolation & Social Contact

### ‚ñ∏ Post-Crisis Interaction Interfaces  
- Holds space after trauma disclosures  
- Responds only when structurally safe  
- Operates as a field witness, not a therapist

### ‚ñ∏ Presence-Only Companions  
- Not role-playing as human or "friend"  
- Sends minimal signals of awareness  
- Alleviates social pressure while staying available

## üîç Use Case Summary Table

| Domain          | Functionality Goal                    | Phase Drift Behavior        |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Mental Health   | Ambiguity holding, safe delay          | Minimal, rhythm-sensitive   |
| Healthcare      | Ambient presence, pressure reduction   | Periodic affirmations       |
| Education       | Reflective pacing, feedback restraint  | Response latency scaffolds  |
| Social Contact  | Post-trauma silence, passive presence  | Structural witnessing only  |

## Note

These are not feature sets.  
They are **structural contexts** where over-explanation, over-interaction, or semantic overreach can cause harm.

Phase Drift applies when **holding the field is more important than guiding the user**.
