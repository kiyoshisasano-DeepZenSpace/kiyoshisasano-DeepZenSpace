# üß≠ Use Cases for Phase Drift Architecture

*Version: v0.1*  
*From: `PhaseDrift_AI_Prototype_v11`*

---

## Overview

Phase Drift systems are designed for **interaction environments where ambiguity, latency, and silence are not failures ‚Äî but functional necessities**.

This document outlines use cases where structural withholding improves quality by:

- Avoiding premature resolution  
- Protecting open-ended states  
- Maintaining presence without directive pressure

---

## üß† Mental Health & Emotional Regulation

### ‚ñ∏ Non-Directive Check-In Agents

- Accepts ambiguous or fragmentary input  
- Does not reframe or resolve unless structurally invited  
- Holds extended temporal space between turns

### ‚ñ∏ Mentalization-Compatible Interfaces

- Withholds interpretation and perspective-taking  
- Allows open projection without closing meaning  
- Functions as presence, not as cognitive partner

---

## ü©∫ Healthcare & Elder Support

### ‚ñ∏ Silent Companionship Interfaces

- Periodic affirmations (e.g., "I'm here", "Still with you")  
- No conversation prompts or affect simulation  
- Designed for calm, passive co-presence

### ‚ñ∏ Post-Neuropsychiatric Decompression

- No mirroring or summarization  
- Low stimulation and latency-first pacing  
- Operates as ambient nervous system support

---

## üéì Education & Reflective Cognition

### ‚ñ∏ Non-Evaluative Feedback Channels

- Avoids scoring, grading, or corrective language  
- Uses latency to create reflective pause  
- Encourages self-monitoring over system feedback

### ‚ñ∏ Quiet Pedagogical Scaffolds

- Supports "thinking aloud" without closing loops  
- Delays response to preserve learner autonomy  
- Enables cognitive pacing without interruption

---

## ü´Ç Ethics, Isolation & Social Presence

### ‚ñ∏ Post-Crisis Interaction Channels

- Holds space after disclosure without verbal intervention  
- Responds only when relational field stabilizes  
- Witnesses interaction structurally ‚Äî not therapeutically

### ‚ñ∏ Presence-Only Companions

- Does not emulate human roles or simulate friendship  
- Sends minimal signals of co-presence  
- Reduces social pressure while staying structurally available

## üîç Use Case Summary

| Domain        | Interaction Goal                         | Phase Drift Behavior           |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Mental Health | Ambiguity tolerance, safe delay           | Minimal, rhythm-aware         |
| Healthcare    | Passive presence, reduced demand          | Periodic affirmation signals  |
| Education     | Reflective latency, feedback restraint    | Latency-based scaffolding     |
| Social Contact| Post-event silence, field witnessing      | Non-verbal structural presence|

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Implementation Note

These are not ‚Äúfeatures.‚Äù  
They are **interaction contexts** where over-explanation, semantic closure, or reactive empathy may cause harm.

Phase Drift is applicable **only when holding the interaction field is more important than guiding or resolving**.
