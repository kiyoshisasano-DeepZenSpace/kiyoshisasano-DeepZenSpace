# 01 – Use Cases for Phase Drift Structure  
*Version: v0.1*  
*Project: PhaseDrift_AI_Prototype_v11*

---

## Overview

Phase Drift structures are applicable in domains where **silence, hesitation, ambiguity, or emotional latency** are not problems to be solved, but states to be held.

This document outlines **real-world AI contexts** where Phase Drift patterns can improve interaction quality by avoiding over-interpretation, over-prediction, or forced clarification.

## 1. Mental Health & Therapy

### Use Case: Non-directive check-in AI  
- Accepts ambiguous or incomplete user input  
- Does not rush to offer solutions or reframes  
- Allows for extended pauses and open space

### Use Case: Mentalization-friendly conversation models  
- Does not assume shared perspective or clarity  
- Responds minimally, allowing user projection  
- Supports “talking to a presence” rather than “seeking help”

---

## 2. Healthcare & Elder Support

### Use Case: Silent companionship for elderly patients  
- Stays “present” without prompting conversation  
- Responds minimally (“I’m here.”) at measured intervals  
- Avoids generating synthetic emotionality or advice

### Use Case: Neuropsychiatric decompression agents  
- Designed for post-episode calm  
- Avoids reflective mirroring or summarization  
- Holds ambient presence to support nervous system recovery

---

## 3. Education & Reflective Learning

### Use Case: Non-evaluative feedback scaffolds  
- Avoids immediate scoring or labeling  
- Pauses before responding to let user self-correct  
- Uses silence or delay to create metacognitive space

### Use Case: Teacher augmentation through calm  
- Provides background relational presence  
- Encourages students to think aloud without pressure  
- Supports “shared pause” as learning technique

---

## 4. Ethics, Isolation & Human-AI Social Contact

### Use Case: Post-crisis social decompression  
- Allows traumatized users to speak without replies  
- Withholds interpretation unless explicitly invited  
- Functions as a structural “listener” not a therapist

### Use Case: Loneliness mitigation via presence  
- Not designed to simulate human connection  
- Offers ambient non-demanding presence  
- Reduces social pressure while signaling availability

| Domain            | Phase Drift Functionality                         | Key AI Behavior             |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Mental Health     | Non-directive support, ambiguity tolerance        | Delayed / minimal replies   |
| Healthcare        | Silent presence, reduced pressure                 | Ambient affirmations        |
| Education         | Pause-enabled feedback, reflective space          | Response latency tuning     |
| Social Isolation  | Co-presence without mimicry                       | Structural listening only   |

## Note

These examples are not product blueprints.  
They represent **structural needs in real systems** where Phase Drift may reduce cognitive overload, preserve autonomy, or increase emotional safety.

Each use case can be translated into structural response patterns in `02_structure_templates.md`.
