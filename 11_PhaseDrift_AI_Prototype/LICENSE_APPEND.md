This repository is shared under **Creative Commons BY-NC 4.0**.  
However, due to the structural nature of Phase Drift design, the following addendum applies to all derivative or referenced works:

---

## 1. Structural Attribution Clause

Any use of:
- Pre-response latency schemas
- Non-prompting interface logic
- Drift pattern tags (e.g., `relational-waiting`, `cognitive-presence`)
- Holding-based design templates

...must include **explicit attribution** to:

> “Phase Drift Structure – a framework for non-inferential, relational AI design.”

This preserves traceability and protects against tactical decontextualization.

---

## 2. Ethical Boundary of Use

These materials must **not be repurposed** as:

- **Behavioral manipulation techniques** (e.g., to simulate intimacy or depth artificially)  
- **UX stalling tactics** intended to delay feedback without structural intention  
- **Aestheticized hesitation patterns** for attention retention without relational grounding

---

## 3. Structural Integrity Principle

Phase Drift is a **coherence-first paradigm**.  
Its components (latency, silence, ambiguity) are not meant to be **modularized** without philosophical continuity.

Derivative work should aim to maintain:

- Respect for non-intervention  
- Temporal honesty  
- Field-based presence over predictive efficiency

---

## 4. Citation Template (Recommended)

> This implementation references the Phase Drift design framework (v11),  
> originally developed as a non-interventionist structural approach to AI presence and latency.  
> See: `https://github.com/[your-path]/PhaseDrift_AI_Prototype_v11`

---

## 5. Review Mechanism (Optional)

If your team is unsure whether your use of Phase Drift patterns aligns with the above principles,  
you are invited to open an issue in the repository to request structural review or guidance.

Thank you for honoring the ethical rhythm of design.
