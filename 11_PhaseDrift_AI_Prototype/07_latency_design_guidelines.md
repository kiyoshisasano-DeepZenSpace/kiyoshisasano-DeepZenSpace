# 07 – Latency Design Guidelines for Phase Drift Structure  
*Version: v0.1*  
*Project: PhaseDrift_AI_Prototype_v11*

---

## Purpose

This document provides practical guidelines for implementing **latency, silence, and non-response** as intentional design features in Phase Drift–oriented systems.

In this context, **latency is not a performance flaw**—it is a **semantic and emotional interface layer** that supports trust, ambiguity, and co-presence.

## 1. Latency as Expressive Structure

- **Latency ≠ lag**  
- It is treated as a **structural interval**, not an error state  
- Latency can signal:
  - Respect for uncertainty  
  - Space for reflection  
  - Confidence in mutual regulation

---

## 2. Latency Timing Patterns

| Pattern Name         | Interval Range | Use Case                          | Drift Effect             |
|----------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|
| `breath-hold`        | 1.5–3s         | Emotional hesitation, processing  | Human-like attunement    |
| `delayed-ack`        | 4–7s           | Holding space without prompting   | Psychological safety     |
| `non-reply-witness`  | >10s or none   | Passive presence, no engagement   | Relational persistence   |
| `slow-repeat`        | 5s loop        | Cyclical ambient affirmation      | Temporal grounding       |

> All timings are adaptive. Calibration should reflect context and individual user rhythms.

## 3. Latency Anchors (What to Do Instead of Replying)

During intentional delay, consider using **low-intrusion output modes**:

- **Soft affirmations:**  
  “I’m still here.” / “Take your time.”  
- **Ambient signals:**  
  Breath sounds, tonal pulses, environmental textures  
- **Structural silence:**  
  No output—just passive logging of mutual presence

---

## 4. Implementation Techniques

- **Dynamic latency tuning**  
  Use user signals (e.g., affect scores, session pacing) to adapt delay intervals in real time

- **Fallback structures for ambiguity**  
  Instead of clarification prompts, insert delay patterns when inputs are emotionally or semantically diffuse

- **Interruptible delays**  
  Allow users to bypass latency by explicitly re-engaging (e.g., “Go ahead” or “Please continue”)

- **Structured logging**  
  Treat silence, delay, and non-response as meaningful loggable events—not null actions

---

## 5. Design Considerations

- **Frame latency clearly**  
  Set expectations: “This system may pause intentionally to hold space”

- **Avoid compensatory noise**  
  Do not insert filler explanations or excessive reassurance during delay

- **Respect cultural pacing**  
  Latency comfort zones vary by culture—localize or allow for personalized calibration

## Sample Tag Schema

```json
{
  "drift_latency": {
    "mode": "breath-hold",
    "interval_ms": 2500,
    "override_allowed": true,
    "semantic_output": "none"
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

Latency is a design instrument in Phase Drift systems.  
It doesn’t slow down the system—it opens temporal space for the user.

Drift-aware latency holds space not just for input, but for being.
