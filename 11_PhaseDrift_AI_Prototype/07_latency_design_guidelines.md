# 07 – Latency Design Guidelines for Phase Drift Structure  
*Version: v0.1*  
*Project: PhaseDrift_AI_Prototype_v11*

---

## Purpose

This document outlines practical guidelines for implementing **latency, silence, and non-response** as deliberate structural features in Phase Drift–based systems.

Latency here is not a limitation, but a **semantic and emotional design layer**. It modulates trust, ambiguity, and co-presence.

---

## 1. Latency as Meaningful Structure

- **Latency ≠ lag**  
- Treated as an *expressive interval*, not an error
- Latency can communicate:
  - Respect for uncertainty  
  - Allowance for reflection  
  - Trust in co-regulation

---

## 2. Latency Timing Patterns

| Pattern Name         | Interval Range | Use Case                          | Drift Effect             |
|----------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|
| `breath-hold`        | 1.5–3s         | Emotional hesitation              | Human-like pause         |
| `delayed-ack`        | 4–7s           | Holding space, not prompting      | Safety signal            |
| `non-reply-witness`  | >10s or none   | Presence without engagement       | Relational endurance     |
| `slow-repeat`        | 5s cyclical    | Ambient affirmation pacing        | Temporal anchoring       |

> All intervals are configurable and must be tested against context and user profile.

## 3. Latency Anchors (What to Do Instead of Replying)

When latency is used, consider these **low-interference output types**:

- Soft affirmations: “I’m still here.” / “Take your time.”  
- Ambient cues: soundscapes, breathing tones, haptic pulse  
- Structural silence: no output, system logs interaction passively

---

## 4. Implementation Techniques

- **Dynamic latency tuning:**  
  Adjust response time based on user rhythm, affect score, or session context

- **Prompt fallbacks:**  
  Use silence or delay templates when inputs are ambiguous or emotional

- **Interruptible delays:**  
  Allow users to override latency by explicit engagement (e.g., “Please continue”)

- **Logging structure:**  
  Silence and non-responses must be treated as structural events in the log schema

---

## 5. Design Considerations

- **Frame latency clearly:**  
  Let users know it is intentional (“This system may take its time”)

- **Avoid compensation traps:**  
  Don’t fill latency with unnecessary explanations or fillers

- **Cultural calibration:**  
  Latency comfort thresholds vary—align with local norms or tune individually
