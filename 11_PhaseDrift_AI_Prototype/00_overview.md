## 🌀 What Is Phase Drift?

**Phase Drift** is not a failure state — it's a structural posture.

It describes a mode of AI-human interaction where **non-response, ambiguity, and delay** are treated as **intentional design signals**, rather than errors to be corrected.

This approach reorients LLM behavior away from interpretation and instruction, and toward **relational field maintenance** — especially useful in sensitive contexts where immediate comprehension is neither expected nor helpful.

> The goal is not to answer faster —  
> but to remain present when meaning hasn’t yet formed.

## 🔧 Key Design Principles

- **Non-predictive Presence**  
  Avoid inferring or accelerating user intent. Wait with them.

- **Latency as Structural Signal**  
  Silence and delay are not voids — they are architecture.

- **Non-Directive Listening**  
  Resist semantic repair. Don’t clarify what wasn’t asked.

- **Field Integrity First**  
  Preserve dialogic space, even without resolution.

## 🎯 Why This Matters

Current LLMs are optimized for:
- Fast interpretation
- Fluent completion
- Goal-directed clarity

But many real-world use cases require something else:

| Use Context                | Problem with Current AI         | Phase Drift Advantage                  |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Mental health check-ins   | Over-responsiveness, false empathy | Structural silence and gentle holding |
| Crisis recovery support   | Too directive                    | Non-imposing presence                  |
| Long-term companionship   | Shallow continuity               | Deep field-based alignment             |

## 🧪 Core Use Cases

- **Silent agents** for palliative care or elder support  
- **Non-intrusive support UIs** for wellness platforms  
- **Delayed feedback tutors** that hold tension, not resolve it  
- **Conversational models** that resist urgency or performance  
- **Field-aware AI** that can remain with ambiguity

## 📁 Contents of This Folder

This folder contains practical and theoretical documents, including:

| File                            | Purpose |
|---------------------------------|---------|
| `01_use_cases.md`              | Domain examples with implications |
| `02_structure_templates.md`    | Structural prompts and responses (non-code) |
| `03_PoC_medical_silent_agent.md` | Proof-of-concept for healthcare presence |
| `04_user_feedback_model.md`    | Expected user reactions and interface intent |
| `99_notes_ethics.md`           | Safety concerns, misuse cases, structural risk |

Each file is both a **design guide** and a **translation artifact** — helping bridge interface thinking with deeper phase alignment.
