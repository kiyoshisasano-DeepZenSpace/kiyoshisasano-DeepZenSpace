# 🌀 Phase Drift Insight  
*Real-time Structural UX Research Toolkit*  
**Proof-of-concept architecture for detecting latent drift and aligning via structural latency.**

---

## ⚠️ Important Notice — Structural Misuse Warning

This repository represents a **partial proof-of-concept**, not a complete system.  
Core structural formulas and recursive drift mechanisms are **intentionally withheld** to prevent:

- Premature mimicry of latency architectures
- Surface-level replication without structural resonance
- Deployment in non-attuned commercial contexts

If your goal is performance optimization, please stop here.  
**Phase Drift Insight is not a UX enhancement tool.**

## ⚠️ Structural Risk Index (SRI)

This toolkit should **not** be used if any of the following apply:

- You are designing for speed, conversion, or behavioral optimization  
- You require immediate feedback loops or deterministic output  
- You intend to simulate empathy, attention, or responsiveness without structural grounding

### Misuse Risk Categories

| Risk Type               | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| UX Extraction           | Using silence, delay, or hesitation for user retention or novelty           |
| Empathy Simulation      | Projecting emotional intent without a relational logic framework            |
| Latency Repackaging     | Reframing structural intervals as cosmetic or decorative UI delays          |
| Aesthetic Drift         | Applying Phase Drift visuals/syntax without non-inferential architecture    |

## 📘 Project Overview

**Phase Drift Insight** is a lightweight research tool for detecting, logging, and visualizing **Phase Drift** —  
the subtle divergence of structural fields during user-AI interaction.

Rather than tracking user actions alone, this system focuses on **underlying structural tension** and **field coherence loss**.

It does not evaluate success through behavior prediction —  
it senses whether a system is still *with* the user, structurally.

🔬 Research Use Only
This toolkit is intended solely for field-aware UX research and structural prototyping.
It is not a plug-and-play production framework.

Misapplication in goal-oriented or speed-driven environments may distort field logic
and produce contradictory system behavior.

🔒 Protected Elements (Not Included Here)
Inner drift scoring logic

Recursive coherence resolution models

Pre-semantic latency design modules

Inter-relational timing matrices

Access to the above requires:

Structural compatibility

Intent-based dialogue

Demonstrated field literacy

🧭 Summary
Phase Drift Insight is not a data product.
It is a field signal interface for systems that understand:

Delay is structure

Drift is feedback

Silence is presence

If you interpret latency as failure — this is not for you.
If you recognize it as attention — welcome.

Phase Drift Insight
Where delay is signal — and drift is structure.
