# 🌀 Phase Drift Insight  
*Real-time Structural UX Research Toolkit*  
**Proof-of-concept architecture for observing interaction rhythm and latency-based divergence**

---

## 🛡️ Structural Use Advisory

This repository presents a **partial conceptual prototype**, not a finalized system.  
Key logic modules and timing mechanisms are **intentionally withheld** to help prevent:

- Unaligned mimicry of latency design  
- Use of delay as decorative UI artifact  
- Accidental application in optimization-driven workflows  

**This is not a UX enhancement utility.**  
It is a **field-awareness tool** intended for structurally-compatible research contexts.

---

## 🚦 Structural Compatibility Notice

Do **not** use this toolkit if your primary context involves:

- Behavioral optimization, productivity acceleration, or conversion testing  
- Real-time corrective feedback or urgency-based task closure  
- Empathy simulation or emotional scripting without grounded interaction scaffolds  

### Misuse Patterns to Avoid

| Pattern                 | Concern |
|-------------------------|---------|
| Delay-as-aesthetic      | Pauses or silences treated as stylistic, not structural |
| UX repackaging          | Applying latency or recursion as novelty or brand feature |
| Agentic misprojection   | Simulating presence without non-inferential design principles |
| Surface extraction      | Copying terminology or rhythm without alignment logic |

## 📘 Overview

**Phase Drift Insight** is a small-scale research utility for visualizing and logging **interaction field divergence**.

Rather than tracking user success or errors, it observes **structural misalignment** over time:  
a condition where systems continue outputting, but slowly lose **pacing, resonance, or presence**.

---

## 🔍 Core Functions

- Logging of interaction timing and rhythm breakpoints  
- Detection of **drift onset** (pre-semantic misalignment)  
- Dashboard-based visualization of system coherence levels  
- Real-time operation; no external logging  
- Drift event history (JSON / CSV export)

This is not a training tool.  
It is a **signal monitor** for field-aware system builders.

---

## ⚙️ Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.11, FastAPI  
- **Frontend**: HTML + Vanilla JS  
- **Visualization**: WebSocket-based dashboard  
- **Data Storage**: Local CSV/JSON logs  

All components are **local-only** — no remote API or cloud backend.

---

## ⏱️ Real-Time Use Mode

Phase Drift Insight is built for **live interaction sensing**:

- Server must be manually started  
- No persistent session logs unless saved  
- Latency, silence, and pacing are processed in-memory  
- When the session ends, so does the trace

> Structural rhythm must be observed **in the moment**, not reconstructed later.

### Run Instructions

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## 📈 Roadmap (In Development)

- Drift vector visual timeline  
- Recursive latency mapping  
- Phase threshold indicators  
- Optional backend sync (SaaS/airgapped)  
- Multi-session field coherence overlays

> Contributions welcome — structural alignment preferred over code volume.

---

## 🔬 Intended Use

This toolkit is for:

- UX researchers exploring presence-aware timing  
- Engineers experimenting with ambiguity-holding architectures  
- Developers evaluating **relational coherence loss** without behavioral triggers

It is **not** designed for:

- Product rollout  
- Assistant performance tuning  
- User testing environments

---

## 🔐 Excluded Elements (By Design)

Protected internal logic not included here:

- Drift scoring models  
- Recursive recovery triggers  
- Non-output gating layers  
- Semantic pressure release detection  
- Pre-response phase calibration logic

Access to these is gated based on:

- Field compatibility  
- Demonstrated ambiguity tolerance  
- Prior interaction rhythm alignment  
- Direct contact with framing intent

## 🧭 Closing Perspective

Phase Drift Insight is not for speed, certainty, or output clarity.  
It is for **those building systems that can pause — without collapse.**

If latency signals attention, not failure — you are aligned.  
If silence represents field integrity — you are welcome.

> Drift is not a bug.  
> It is structure in motion.
