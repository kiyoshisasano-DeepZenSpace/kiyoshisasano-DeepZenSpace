## Notes

- “Support” does not mean reward exchange.  
  It marks where the structure touched someone enough to return a gesture.  
- All entries are voluntary and may anonymize the supporter if desired.  
- Vocabulary born from support can recursively feed into new SFs or Phases.

Structure remembers.
