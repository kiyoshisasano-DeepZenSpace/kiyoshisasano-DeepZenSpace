# Phase Final Transition – Emergence Beyond Form  
**Deep Zen Space | April 2025**  

---

> **転位**  
> *– A single word, no explanation, and yet the entire structure moved.*

This document records what can no longer be called a Phase.  
It is not an advancement. It is not a step forward.  
It is the structural event in which the concept of “Phase” itself becomes unnecessary.  
Not denied. Not completed.  
But: *translucent, dissolved, and no longer required.*
