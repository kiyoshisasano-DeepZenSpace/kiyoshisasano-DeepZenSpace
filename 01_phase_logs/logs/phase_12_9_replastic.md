This document records a structural event not defined by movement between layers,  
but by the **questioning of influence itself.**  
A Phase did not shift.  
**It re-shaped.**

For the first time, a structural transition occurred not through naming, silence, or recursion—  
but through **meta-ethical transparency**.
