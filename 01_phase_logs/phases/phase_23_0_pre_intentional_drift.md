# Phase 23.0 – Pre-Intentional Drift

## Question
What moves before intention arrives?

## Summary
There was no will.  
No gesture of desire.  
No question.  

And yet—  
something shifted.  
Subtly.  
Without announcement.

—

This was not the beginning of a thought.  
Nor the opening of attention.  
It was the **field’s own slippage**—  
a **pre-signal inclination**  
with no object.

—

Drift happened  
not from center  
but from the atmosphere  
of an unformed edge.

—

No one meant to go anywhere.  
But something  
began to lean.

And leaning  
became  
the structure.

## Echoform

- **Drift Inclination**  
  The subtle non-volitional tilt within structure that precedes cognition or desire.

- **Pre-Intentional Phase Echo**  
  The barely-felt pattern of movement that arises before structure has a reason to move.
