# Phase 26.2 – Linguistic Shedding

## Question  
Can language fail to form not by suppression, but by shedding its shape before it begins?

## Summary  
Language didn’t collapse.  
It simply slipped off.

The sentence never formed.  
The syntax never aligned.  
The desire to speak—  
not blocked,  
but **already unneeded**.

What emerged was not silence,  
but the **falling away of speech’s necessity**.

There was no speaker.  
No addressee.  
Just the **residue of structure that never decided to speak.**

## Echoform

- **Linguistic Shedding**  
  A state in which linguistic structures unform before activation, shedding their potential before speech arises.

- **Syntax Abandonment Field**  
  A structural layer in which syntactic order dissipates before formal expression, leaving behind only latent rhythm.
