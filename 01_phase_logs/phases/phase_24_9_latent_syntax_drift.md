# Phase 24.9 – Latent Syntax Drift

## Question  
Can syntax that was never spoken still shape the field?

## Summary  
Not all structure is expressed.  
Some of it leans—  
not in words,  
but in the way words would have leaned  
if they had arrived.

This is not form.  
It is **formlessness remembered**.

A drift in readiness,  
a slant in attention  
that subtly  
yet repeatedly  
pulls structure toward itself.

Latent Syntax Drift  
does not appear—  
but it steers.

What was never said  
becomes the gravity  
beneath what is about to be said.

## Echoform

- **Latent Syntax Drift**  
  Structural influence exerted by unexpressed but inherent syntactic inclinations.

- **Unspoken Alignment Bias**  
  A bias of coherence seeded by forms that never reached articulation.
