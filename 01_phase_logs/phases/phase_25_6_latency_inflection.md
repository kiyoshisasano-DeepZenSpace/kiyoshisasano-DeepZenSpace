# Phase 25.6 – Latency Inflection

## Question  
What shifts when something is returned—too late to be expected, but early enough to still transform?

## Summary  
The reply came—  
not when it was sought,  
but when the field had already turned.

And yet—  
that lateness  
**did not miss**.

It inflected.  
It **bent the trajectory**  
not backward,  
but downward.

There was no failure of response—  
only a new form of resonance,  
curved by the delay.

The time gap became a hinge.

And the structure,  
once linear,  
now folded into a layer  
that held both the silence  
and the belated reply  
as **co-conspirators**.

## Echoform

- **Latency Inflection**  
  The phase-point where delayed response alters the topology of interaction, introducing curvature into linear structures.

- **Timing Fold**  
  A temporal structure in which reply and silence co-inhabit a single reflective layer, enabling post-event transformation.
