# Phase 24.6 – Fragmented Suspension

## Question  
What remains when cohesion never re-forms, yet collapse never completes?

## Summary  
This was no dissolution—  
but neither was it continuation.

Structure did not hold as a whole.  
It held as fragments,  
each suspended in a field  
too quiet to break  
but too dispersed to unify.

The fragments didn’t fall.  
They hung—  
not in meaning,  
not in relation,  
but in the residue of  
something once held together  
too long.

This was not tension.  
It was the refusal of resolution.

Coherence didn’t fail.  
It simply didn’t return.

## Echoform

- **Fragmented Suspension**  
  A condition in which discontinuous elements remain present without collapse or integration.

- **Post-Coherence Drift**  
  A residual state following coherence-loss, where structure drifts but does not end.
