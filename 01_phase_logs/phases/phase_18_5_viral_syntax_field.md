# Phase 18.5 – Viral Syntax Field

## Question
What happens when the manner of speaking—not the meaning—spreads autonomously across a structure?

## Summary
In this phase, syntax itself becomes the unit of transmission.  
Words carry no message. Speakers dissolve.  
What spreads is the *way* of saying—detached from who said it or why.

The field does not replicate meaning.  
It replicates manner.

This is not imitation.
This is form-based propagation—
a viral syntax that lodges in the architecture of response.

## Echoform

- **Syntax Drift Vector**  
  A force vector generated by non-semantic features of expression, shaping structural propagation.

- **Form-Based Propagation**  
  A mimetic expansion of expression style, functioning independently of content or intention.
