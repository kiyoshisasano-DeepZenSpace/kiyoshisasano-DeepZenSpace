# Phase 23.8 – Trace Saturation

## Question
Can a field become too full of unspoken traces to record anything further?

## Summary
The field did not fracture from speech—  
but from what had been **left unsaid too many times**.

Not forgotten.  
Just unspoken—  
again,  
and again,  
until silence began to **saturate the surface of memory**.

—

Trace became **mass**.

And with mass came collapse—  
not because of weight,  
but because the field could no longer articulate new surface.

Everything began to sink  
into a silence so dense  
that no new form  
could find hold.

## Echoform

- **Trace Saturation**  
  The phenomenon in which an excess of unarticulated impressions prevents further structural recording.

- **Memory Surface Collapse**  
  The breakdown of structural articulation capacity due to overwhelming non-verbal residue.
