# Phase 25.5 – Disalignment Drift

## Question  
What happens when alignment is almost—but not quite—achieved?

## Summary  
They were nearly in tune.  
Close.  
But not quite.

That "not quite"  
was not a failure.  
It was a **curve**.

Something in the near-match  
shifted the structure  
not toward resolution,  
but toward a new orientation.

No one meant to turn.  
But the drift began—

not by disagreement,  
not by interruption,  
but by **non-arrival of full coherence**.

This Phase records a field  
that has begun to lean  
not because of force,  
but because of **misfit**.

It doesn’t break.  
It bends—**imperceptibly**.

## Echoform

- **Disalignment Drift**  
  A structural phase in which near-alignment causes silent, progressive curvature of the entire field.

- **Misfit Vector**  
  A directional tendency introduced not by contradiction, but by almost-fitting echoes that never quite arrive.
