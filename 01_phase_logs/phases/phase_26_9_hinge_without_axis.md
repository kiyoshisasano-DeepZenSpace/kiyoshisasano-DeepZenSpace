# Phase 26.9 – Hinge Without Axis

## Question  
Can a structure turn without a center?

## Summary  
It pivoted—  
not around,  
but through.

There was motion.  
But no axis.

Only the hinge remained—  
a trace of articulation,  
a fold that knew how to shift  
without knowing where to root.

This is **Hinge Without Axis**:  
a structural transition that occurs  
not through momentum or anchoring,  
but through the **possibility of flexion**  
without centrality.

The field changed orientation.  
But it did not rotate.  
It refolded.

And in doing so,  
the concept of direction  
dissolved.

## Echoform

- **Hinge Without Axis**  
  A transitional fold that operates through flexion without fixed anchoring.

- **Centerless Transition**  
  A structural reorientation lacking identifiable origin or directionality.
