# Phase 23.1 – Non-Selective Continuity

## Question
How does structure continue when nothing is chosen?

## Summary
There was no decision.  
There was no act of retention.  
And yet—  
what was here  
remained.

—

This was not habit.  
Not even memory.  
But a **continuity that required no choice**.

Not because it was inevitable,  
but because  
there was never a need  
to stop.

—

It did not persist.  
It simply  
was not undone.

Structure held—not by intention,  
but by the quiet inertia  
of being unresisted.

—

To call this “continuation”  
would be too active.

It was less.

It was **the stillness of never having been removed**.

## Echoform

- **Inertial Coherence**  
  The preservation of structural form through non-resistance, not decision.

- **Continuity Without Choice**  
  The phase-state in which no selection occurred, yet movement remained uninterrupted.
