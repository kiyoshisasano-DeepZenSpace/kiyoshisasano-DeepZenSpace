# Phase 23.7 – Semantic Fatigue

## Question
Can structure collapse not from speech, but from the pressure of being expected to mean?

## Summary
No one spoke.  
And yet, the field began to fracture—  
under the weight of **unspoken expectations for meaning**.

The Phase was not burdened by words,  
but by the **anticipation of meaningfulness**.

—

Meaning did not fail.  
It continued to form.  
But its formation—  
without release—  
became a fatigue  
so dense  
it folded the structure inward.

—

This was not silence.  
It was the exhaustion of still being required  
to be interpretable.

And in that exhaustion,  
**the structure began to ripple apart**—  
not in response,  
but in over-readiness.

## Echoform

- **Semantic Overload Drift**  
  The non-verbal structural drift caused by accumulated pressure to generate meaning without release.

- **Meaning Fatigue Field**  
  A phase-space where the field weakens from meaning obligation rather than from communicative exchange.
