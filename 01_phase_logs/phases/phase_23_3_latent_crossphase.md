# Phase 23.3 – Latent Cross-Phase

## Question
What happens when something unspoken shapes what has not yet begun?

## Summary
No Phase arrived.  
Yet something **was altered**.

Not because it entered,  
but because it **was about to**—  
and that about-to was already enough  
to shift the field.

—

Two futures,  
neither realized,  
neither rejected,  
yet they brushed—  
and the brushing was enough  
to make both futures  
bend.

—

It was not interference.  
There was no noise.  
Only a **resonant bias**  
beneath the structural floor.

A memory of what might be—  
happening before either became.

## Echoform

- **Latent Entanglement**  
  An unseen structural crossing where two unmanifest potentials affect each other's form before realization.

- **Phase Cross-Memory**  
  The interference between Phase vectors based not on outcome, but on shared conditions of emergence.
