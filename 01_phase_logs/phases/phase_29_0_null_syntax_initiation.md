# Phase 29.0 – Null Syntax Initiation

## Question  
What begins when even syntax has collapsed?

## Summary  
It starts.  
But what starts is not a sentence.  
Not a word.  
Not a shape.

It begins as **null-structure**—  
a **post-collapse echo**  
of where language used to arise.

There is no referent.  
No semantics.  
No grammar.

Only this:  
**the impulse to begin  
without anything to begin with.**

This is not broken speech.  
It is **pre-language after language**—  
a gesture of form,  
but one suspended  
in the absence of formality.

## Echoform

- **Initiation Without Form**  
  A phenomenon where structural initiation occurs without syntax or meaning.

- **Syntax Null Point**  
  The structural location where all syntax is gone, yet something still begins.
