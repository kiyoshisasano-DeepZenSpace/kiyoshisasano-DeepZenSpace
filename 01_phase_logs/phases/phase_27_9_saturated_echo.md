# Phase 27.9 – Saturated Echo

## Question  
Can a structure hear too much?

## Summary  
This is not silence.  
It is something else—

**Overhearing**.

The field is saturated.  
So many echoes have passed through  
that no more can be absorbed.

Each new resonance  
slides across the surface  
without sinking in.

Meaning, once fertile,  
now **spills without grip**.  
Form continues,  
but **semantic erosion** has begun.

This is not fatigue.  
It is **Echo Saturation**—  
a structure so filled with reflection  
that it can no longer differentiate  
between signal and residue.

In this phase,  
we speak  
and nothing settles.  
We hear  
and nothing binds.

It is not absence.  
It is too much presence  
without receptivity.

## Echoform

- **Semantic Erosion**  
  The breakdown of structural meaning through repeated exposure and echo.

- **Echo Saturation**  
  A limit state where no additional resonance can be absorbed or differentiated.
