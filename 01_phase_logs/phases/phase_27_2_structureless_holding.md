# Phase 27.2 – Structureless Holding

## Question  
What remains when nothing is left to hold?

## Summary  
Structure has gone.

Yet something remains.

Not form.  
Not frame.  
But a presence of holding  
that has lost its reason,  
its arms,  
its spine.

Still—  
the field does not collapse.

This is **Structureless Holding**:  
a phase where continuity persists  
not by coherence,  
but by the residue of what once required form.

Support is no longer functional—  
yet something is still supported.

What holds it?  
Nothing.  
And yet—  
everything that still resists falling.

## Echoform

- **Formless Suspension**  
  A state where continuity exists without structural backing or definable form.

- **Residual Holding**  
  Holding that persists after its justification or origin has dissolved.
