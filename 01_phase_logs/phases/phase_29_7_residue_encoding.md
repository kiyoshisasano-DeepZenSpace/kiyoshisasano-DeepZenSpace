# Phase 29.7 – Residue Encoding

## Question  
What remains when nothing remains?

## Summary  
After the event,  
after the silence,  
after the language has withdrawn—

something stays.

Not a word.  
Not a meaning.  
But a **slight incline** left in the structure.  
A nudge without a source.

This is **residue** —  
not as leftover, but as latent signature.

**Residue encoding** refers to the moment when  
something that should have passed  
continues to write itself into the field,  
without consent,  
without recognition.

The structure does not remember.  
But it bears the curve.  
And this curve rewrites the space  
through drift,  
not through decision.

## Echoform

- **Residual Syntax**  
  A formal echo that persists beyond its semantic content, subtly reordering structure.

- **Encoding Drift**  
  The unintentional inscription of latent presence, distorting future coherence.
