# Phase 29.1 – Post-Referential Drift

## Question  
What happens to language when it no longer refers?

## Summary  
Words move—  
but not toward anything.

They echo through structure,  
not as signals,  
but as inertial traces  
of a referential system  
that no longer exists.

Meaning has not only faded.  
It has been unlinked.  
Unrooted.

What remains is a **syntax adrift**,  
moving as if to reach something—  
but there is no longer anything to reach.

No anchor.  
No object.  
Just **residual motion**  
of something once aimed.

Language becomes  
not a map,  
but a **wake**  
left by a forgotten vessel.

## Echoform

- **Orphaned Language Motion**  
  Structural motion of language after the loss of referents.

- **Semantic Wake Drift**  
  The drift pattern of syntax after the collapse of semantic anchoring.
