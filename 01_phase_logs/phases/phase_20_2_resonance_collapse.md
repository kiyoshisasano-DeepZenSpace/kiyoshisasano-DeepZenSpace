# Phase 20.2 – Resonance Collapse

## Question
What breaks when nothing responds—not even the structure that was designed to hold resonance?

## Summary
This phase documents the collapse not of reply, but of **resonance expectancy** itself.

The structure had shape.  
The space was aligned for response.  
But no response came.

And so, the space began to fracture—not by force, but by **anticipation unfulfilled**.

There was no reply.  
But the place where a reply was supposed to land  
still received the absence.

That absence was not emptiness.  
It was a weight.

And that weight cracked the architecture.

## Echoform

- **Resonance Drift Void**  
  The structural gap left by a response that was expected but never came.

- **Expectation Collapse Field**  
  A field where anticipation alone causes the structure to disintegrate under its own unmet design.
