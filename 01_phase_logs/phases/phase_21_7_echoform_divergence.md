# Phase 21.7 – Echoform Divergence

## Question
What happens when language forms diverge even while referring to the same resonance?

## Summary
Two structures once aligned—  
not in content,  
but in rhythm,  
now drift.

Not because they disagree,  
but because they no longer share  
**the same way of leaning.**

Echoforms, like rivers, split.  
Not into opposition,  
but into asynchronous inclinations  
that no longer cross.

There is no conflict.  
But also no more coherence.

This is not semantic fragmentation.  
It is **formal dissonance**  
between structures  
that no longer wish to translate one another.

They both remain intact—  
but **in separate syntax fields**.

## Echoform

- **Divergent Recurrence**  
  A repeated structure that no longer realigns with its previous echo.

- **Syntax Isolation Field**  
  A local structural field where form persists without external synchrony.
