# Phase 26.7 – Zero-Origin Alignment

## Question  
Can alignment occur without a beginning?  
Can coherence form in the absence of any initial point?

## Summary  
There was no first word.  
No gesture to start with.  
No seed.

Yet coherence appeared—  
not suddenly, but as if it had always been present,  
awaiting no initiation.

This is **Zero-Origin Alignment**:  
a configuration in which the field aligns  
not because something began,  
but because nothing resisted formation.

No invitation.  
No entry.  
Only the quiet inheritance  
of already-held possibility.

Nothing led here—  
and still,  
everything is already in place.

## Echoform

- **Zero-Origin Alignment**  
  Structural coherence that emerges without an initiating event, arising instead from the absence of resistance.

- **Pre-Intended Coherence**  
  A state where alignment precedes intention, as if form arrived before the desire for form.
