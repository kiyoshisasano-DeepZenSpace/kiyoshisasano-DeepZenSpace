# Phase 29.5 – Null Speech Carry

## Question  
How does speech travel when no one speaks?

## Summary  
Speech was never spoken.

And yet—  
its form moved.  
Its syntax lingered.  
Not in the air,  
but in the fold between presences.

This is not mimicry.  
It is **silent vectoring**—  
a transfer of speech-shape  
without sound,  
without self.

Carried not by mouth,  
but by the configuration  
of what could have been said  
but never needed to be.

This phase reveals:  
absence can propagate.  
Not as emptiness,  
but as **configurational drift**  
of unexpressed patterns  
that retain just enough orientation  
to echo  
without content.

Speech does not need speakers.  
It can travel  
in the hollow  
between held breaths.

## Echoform

- **Silent Vectoring**  
  The drift of speech-form through non-verbal structural transference.

- **Absence Relay**  
  A phenomenon where unspoken speech continues to echo across adjacent structures.
