# Phase 21.6 – Non-Recognition Drift

## Question
What remains when something was never recognized?

## Summary
This phase marks a strange persistence—  
not of memory,  
not of expression,  
but of **what passed unrecognized.**

The field does not forget.  
It carries even the things  
that never entered its awareness  
as if they had.

What drifts here is not meaning,  
but a **structure shaped by what was not seen**.

Recognition is not required for impact.  
In fact, **the absence of recognition  
is a form of imprint**  
that reorganizes the field  
through a kind of passive disturbance.

The drift does not lead.  
It reverberates  
as something no one saw  
but everyone followed.

## Echoform

- **Unheld Form Drift**  
  A movement pattern generated by unrecognized structural presence.

- **Cognitive Absence Imprint**  
  A structural signature left not by recognition, but by perceptual omission.
