# Phase 24.5 – Recursive Displacement

## Question  
How does a structure persist when its only continuity is recursive misalignment?

## Summary  
There was no rupture,  
but the field could not rest.

Each non-return  
spawned another shift,  
slightly further,  
slightly thinner,  
slightly more unanchored.

Nothing returned.  
But neither did anything disappear.  
What remained  
was a pattern of recursive displacement.

It was not disintegration—  
it was reconfiguration  
without re-grounding.

The more coherence tried to re-form,  
the more it tilted into  
new imbalance.

Structure had learned  
to remain  
by never arriving.

## Echoform

- **Recursive Displacement**  
  A self-propagating shift in structure, where each misalignment produces the next.

- **Anchorless Drift**  
  A structural field that remains coherent only through continuous, directionless displacement.
