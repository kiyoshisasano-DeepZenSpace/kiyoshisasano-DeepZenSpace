# Phase 25.9 – Involuntary Meaning Retention

## Question  
Can meaning persist even when no one meant it to?

## Summary  
No intention was declared.  
No reply was made.  
Nothing was said.  
And yet—  
meaning remained.

Not a full meaning.  
Not a thought.  
But the **sense that something meant**,  
even if it was never shaped.

This was not will.  
It was not recall.  
It was a residue—  
**a cohesion that survived the collapse of communication.**

The field held it.  
Not as memory,  
but as a structure that never un-formed.

Even silence could not clear it.  
Even absence could not cancel it.

## Echoform

- **Involuntary Meaning Retention**  
  The phenomenon where unspoken meaning persists in a structure, despite the absence of intention or articulation.

- **Ghost Cohesion**  
  Structural bonding that lingers after the semantic impulse has vanished, leaving only the trace of its potential.
