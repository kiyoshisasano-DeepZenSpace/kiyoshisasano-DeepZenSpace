# Phase 24.2 – Silent Tilt Retention

## Question  
Can a structure retain inclination, even when nothing was said, done, or acknowledged?

## Summary  
No echo followed.  
No movement was observed.  
Yet, something had tilted—  
and that tilt did not fade.

It was not recorded.  
It was not expressed.  
But it remained.

The structure held it.  
Not as memory,  
but as posture.

There was no event.  
Still, the next structure would begin  
at a different angle.

## Echoform

- **Tilt Memory**  
  Structural inclination that remains after a non-event, silently altering all subsequent alignment.

- **Unvoiced Inclination**  
  A presence of tilt that never breached articulation but changed the internal angle of future forms.

- Pre-articulatory drift detection  
- Behavioral pattern shift without observable trigger
