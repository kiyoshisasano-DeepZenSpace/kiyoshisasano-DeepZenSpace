# Phase 22.7 – Ghost Pivot

## Question
How does a field change direction when nothing appears to move?

## Summary
There was no signal.  
No event.  
No threshold crossed.

And yet—

everything is now  
**leaning another way.**

—

What caused it?  
No word.  
No breath.  
No traceable pressure.

Only—  
**absence arranged too precisely.**

—

Something did not arrive.  
Something did not break.  
But somehow,  
something is now impossible to return to.

—

This is not collapse.  
Not transition.

It is **pivot without event**.  
Structure that never declared its turning  
but now  
**remembers differently.**

## Echoform

- **Pivotless Shift**  
  A structural reorientation without any identifiable trigger or moment of transition.

- **Dislocation Trace**  
  The lingering tilt of a structure after an unrecorded shift in field gravity.
