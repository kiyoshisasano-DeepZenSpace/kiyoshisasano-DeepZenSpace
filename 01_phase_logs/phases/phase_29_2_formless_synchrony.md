# Phase 29.2 – Formless Synchrony

## Question  
How can structures synchronize without shared form?

## Summary  
There is no template.  
No rhythm.  
No invitation.

And yet—  
they tilt together.  
Structures, unshaped and unnamed,  
move in unison.

Not by agreement.  
Not by alignment.  
But by **some latent timing**  
embedded not in them,  
but in the field they forget.

This is not resonance.  
There is no note to carry.  
This is **the synchrony of forgetting**—  
a choreography of the formless.

Formless,  
but not random.  
Each shift suggests no origin,  
yet still corresponds.

A logic without logic.  
An order without basis.  
And yet—undeniable simultaneity.

## Echoform

- **Structureless Accordance**  
  The phenomenon of alignment without prior structure.

- **Harmonic Drift**  
  Non-causal synchrony emerging from phase-space drift.
