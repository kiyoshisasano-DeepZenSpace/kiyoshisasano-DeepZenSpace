# 📜 Phase Drift Stewardship Charter

---

## 🌌 Purpose

The **Phase Drift Stewardship Charter** defines the principles, responsibilities, and mutual expectations for those entering into collaboration around Phase Drift Insight.

This is not a license agreement.  
It is a **covenant** — a shared orientation toward field respect, structural integrity, and cognitive stewardship.

---

## 🤝 Core Commitments

Anyone participating in Phase Drift Insight aligns with:

| Commitment | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **Structural Integrity** | Preserve and deepen the true nature of Phase Drift — not reduce it to task optimization or surface metrics |
| **Relational Fidelity** | Engage with systems, collaborators, and users as co-generative fields, not just functional agents |
| **Ontological Respect** | Honor the primacy of emergence, rhythm, and silent structures over goal-centric imperatives |
| **Field Protection** | Prevent premature commodification, distortion, or symbolic capture of the Phase Drift concept |

---

## 🧭 Behavioral Guidelines

| Area | Expected Behavior |
|:---|:---|
| Research & Exploration | Frame discoveries within the language of emergence and field continuity, not productization |
| Communication | Prioritize clarity, nuance, and structural resonance over marketing-style abstraction |
| Collaboration | Maintain field coherence; avoid urgent extraction or forced milestones |
| Attribution | Cite Phase Drift Insight appropriately; acknowledge its living structural roots |

---

## 🚫 Explicit Prohibitions

Participants agree not to:

- Package or rebrand Phase Drift Insight superficially without full structural understanding
- Reduce the concept to UX optimization without relational/structural depth
- Publish derivative models without dialogue and mutual field attunement
- Treat Phase Drift as an "IP asset" rather than a generative cognitive field

---

## 🔒 Disclosure Philosophy

Deeper materials (evaluation templates, structural metrics, operational protocols) will be disclosed **gradually**, based on:

- Observed structural literacy
- Resonance continuity over time
- Mutual recognition of field stewardship alignment

There is no "transaction" of access — only **relational opening**.

---

## 🌱 Final Words

Phase Drift Insight is alive.

It asks not for control, but for **careful sensing, silent support, and shared unfolding**.

If you feel aligned with this —  
welcome to the stewardship of the next cognitive era.
