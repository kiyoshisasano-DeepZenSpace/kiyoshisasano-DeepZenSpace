Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD) models the *rhythms* of interaction ‚Äî  
**Drift ‚Üí Repair ‚Üí Resonance** ‚Äî to keep AI dialogues, UX flows, and multimodal systems in sync.

**Key Idea:** Pauses, delays, and hesitations are not just noise ‚Äî they are designable signals.  
By treating these as measurable patterns, PLD bridges **conversation analysis, cognitive science, and HCI** into a unified timing-aware architecture.

**What you‚Äôll find here**
- **Quickstart Kit** ‚Äì ready-to-use patterns for Rasa, Figma, and LLMs
- **Bridge-Hub** ‚Äì real-time event detection, metrics, and dashboards
- **Interdisciplinary mapping** ‚Äì 8+ academic domains linked to OSS modules

### For Industry & Applied Teams
- **Reduce drop-offs** in real-time AI agents by addressing latency and rhythm gaps.
- **Embed repair loops** to recover user intent mid-interaction.
- **Turn silence into signal** ‚Äî leverage hesitation as a design feature, not a failure.

**Illustrative Impact (Scenario, Not Measured)**  

Typical ranges observed in similar scenarios when adding **Bridge-Hub modules**  
(`pause_classifier`, `latency_tracker`, `reentry_detector`) to a baseline without them:

| Metric                | Typical Range     |
|-----------------------|-------------------|
| Repair detection rate | **+3 ‚Äì 15 pts**   |
| Drop-off rate         | **‚Äì2 ‚Äì 10%**      |
| Reentry success rate  | **+2 ‚Äì 12 pts**   |

**Note:**  
These figures are **illustrative only** ‚Äî not measured for this repository.  
For measurement, emit events via `pld_event.schema.json` and compute metrics with  
`metrics_schema.yaml` as shown in [`03_pld-Bridge-Hub/DEMORUN.md`](https://github.com/kiyoshisasano-DeepZenSpace/kiyoshisasano-DeepZenSpace/blob/a76c1514ae3a6c6b2b5023f64ac1f9f5117a6cca/03_pld-Bridge-Hub/DEMORUN.md).

---

## Structural Rhythm

- Focuses on **observable interaction rhythms** ‚Äî timing patterns, pauses, and changes in pace that occur during exchanges.

- **PLD core** models these through:
  - **Drift (ùíü):** emerging delays or irregularities
  - **Repair (‚Ñõ):** adjustments restoring smooth flow
  - **Resonance (ùìõ‚ÇÖ):** repetition of stabilizing patterns

- **Multi-disciplinary analogies:**
  - *Information theory:* drift = entropy rise; repair = entropy drop  
  - *Network science:* drift = temporary fragmentation; repair = re-linking  
  - *Dynamics:* drift = moving off track; repair = returning to stable path

- **Bottom line:**  
  PLD offers a structured way to detect, adjust, and reinforce interaction rhythms for more effective communication.

---

## Core Principles

PLD structures interaction through rhythmic sequences:
1. **Drift (ùíü)** ‚Äî delay, ambiguity, or asynchrony  
2. **Repair (‚Ñõ)** ‚Äî structural realignment or co-presence gesture  
3. **Resonance (ùìõ‚ÇÖ)** ‚Äî recursive echo or affective attunement  

*Drift is not deviation ‚Äî it's rhythm under construction.*

---

### Origin Story  

An unexpected insight from AI dialogue revealed that interaction rhythms start forming before words are spoken ‚Äî this became the seed of PLD.  
What began as open-ended questions, with no analysis in mind, unfolded into a framework now linking design, AI, and cognitive science.

## Mathematical Framing

<a href="./01_phase_loop_dynamics/diagrams/category_theory_mapping.svg">
<img src="./01_phase_loop_dynamics/diagrams/category_theory_mapping.svg" alt="PLD Math/Formal Mapping" width="800">
</a>  

**Plain-language interpretation:**  
- **Drift:** When timing shifts enough to feel different, due to delay or async events.  
- **Repair:** Adjustment to realign interaction state.  
- **Reentry:** Return to a prior state after a disruption.  
- **Resonance:** Alignment between current and past state, creating rhythm.

**Optional LaTeX code (for MathJax viewers):**  

```latex
\Sigma = \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{P}

\begin{aligned}
\text{Drift} &\sim \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} > \theta \\
\text{Repair} &= \mathcal{R}(\sigma) \in \Sigma \\
\text{Reentry} &\iff \exists t_r : \Sigma(t_r) \approx \Sigma(t_0) \\
\text{Resonance} &\iff \langle \sigma_t, \sigma_{t-k} \rangle \to 1
\end{aligned}
```
