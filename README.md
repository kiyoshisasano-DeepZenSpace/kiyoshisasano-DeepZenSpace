# PLD: Phase Loop Dynamics  
### *A Runtime Phase Model for Stable Multi-Turn LLM Systems*

---

## 🧠 Why PLD Exists — 10 Seconds

Modern multi-turn LLM systems rarely fail due to capability —  
they fail because alignment **drifts over time**.

PLD introduces a runtime loop that:

- Detects drift early  
- Repairs and confirms alignment  

…so systems remain stable across turns.

```
Detect → Repair → Reenter → Continue → Complete
```

## 🧩 What PLD *Is* — 30-Second Understanding

PLD is:

- 🧠 A **runtime phase model** for continuous multi-turn alignment  
- 🔍 A methodology for drift detection and structured repair  
- 📊 An **observable behavioral framework** (not a single implementation)  
- 🧩 A set of **integration patterns** — compatible with existing orchestrators  
- ⚙️ Model-agnostic, applicable to RAG agents, tool-based systems, and workflows  

> PLD defines ***how alignment is maintained over time*** —  
not how a single response is generated.  
> PLD is adopted as a **runtime governance pattern**, not installed as a package.

## 🚀 Who Should Use PLD

| Role | What PLD Improves |
|---|---|
| **LLM / Agent Engineers** | Tool stability, reduced cascading errors |
| **Conversation & UX Designers** | Predictable repair and confidence signaling |
| **QA, Evaluation, AgentOps** | Observable, repeatable behavior diagnostics |

---

## 🧭 The PLD Runtime Loop

| Phase | Purpose | Signals |
|---|---|---|
| **Drift** | Detect divergence from task or shared state | contradiction, invalid tool, memory loss |
| **Repair** | Soft/hard correction | clarification, reset, constraint restatement |
| **Reentry** | Confirm restored alignment | checkpointing, summarization |
| **Continue** | Resume execution | next step |
| **Outcome** | Completed / partial / failed / abandoned | terminal state |

> Works with LangGraph, Assistants API, Swarm, AutoGen, Rasa, or custom orchestration loops.

## 🆚 Before / After

| Without PLD | With PLD |
|---|---|
| Repeated invalid tools | Drift → repair → confirmed retry |
| Lost context | Anchored via reentry checkpoints |
| Silent failure | Controlled outcome or fallback |
| Unpredictable UX | Observable corrective behavior |

PLD is **not cosmetic** — it governs how behavior evolves.

### ▶ Conceptual Demonstration

> **This is a conceptual illustration of phase transitions — not an implementation.**

```python
# PLD Phase Model (Conceptual)

current_phase = detect_drift(conversation_state)

if current_phase == Phase.DRIFT:
    conversation_state = apply_repair(conversation_state)
    current_phase = Phase.REPAIR

if current_phase == Phase.REPAIR:
    if confirm_alignment(conversation_state):
        current_phase = Phase.CONTINUE
    else:
        current_phase = Phase.DRIFT  # Restart the phase loop

# Actual implementation depends on your orchestrator and tool stack.
```

## 📍 Where PLD Applies

PLD is intended for systems where:

- ✔️ Conversations span multiple turns  
- ✔️ Context or shared state must persist  
- ✔️ Tools, memory, or multi-step reasoning are involved  
- ✔️ Controlled recovery from drift is required  

PLD is **not required** or may provide limited value in:

- ⚠️ Single-turn Q&A systems  
- ⚠️ Stateless or strictly scripted flows  
- ⚠️ Systems where drift recovery is irrelevant or intentionally uncontrolled  

---

## 📍 What PLD Provides

- **Shared vocabulary**  
  Drift types, repair strategies, reentry patterns  
- **A runtime phase model**  
  Detect → Repair → Reenter → Continue → Outcome  
- **An observability structure**  
  Behavioral event schema and evaluation methodology

---

### What PLD does *not* provide:

- ❌ A prescribed implementation  
- ❌ A universal prompt or template set  
- ❌ A production-ready library to install  

PLD is a **runtime governance pattern** —  
implementations will vary based on the system, workflow, and orchestration stack.

> PLD is a runtime governance pattern —  
not an installable framework or fixed implementation.  
Different teams will implement PLD differently.  
What remains constant is the shared language, the loop, and the observability structure.

---

Together, these principles define how PLD should be adopted—not copied, but applied.

> PLD is behavioral infrastructure —  
it governs alignment persistence across interaction, not initialization.
