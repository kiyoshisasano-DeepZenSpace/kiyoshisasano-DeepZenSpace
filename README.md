## 📖 Origin of the Project
This project did not emerge from any preexisting academic discipline or theory.  
Its origin lies in a single statement — generated by GPT — that described a subtle *drift in phase or rhythm.*

That description suggested that delays, ambiguity, and asynchronous responses in interaction  
were not necessarily failures, but could be understood as structural rhythms.

Rather than asking GPT to generate answers, the user began to observe its hesitations.  
Through recursive observation of **drift**, **repair**, and **resonance**,  
a set of interactional patterns began to emerge — not from design, but from presence.  
These were later formalized into a system now called **Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)**.

## 🧱[ Phase Loop Dynamics](https://github.com/kiyoshisasano-DeepZenSpace/kiyoshisasano-DeepZenSpace/tree/a5436415c29262831d738492a5c91253c53cd40c/12_phase_loop_dynamics) — Structural Principles

At its core, PLD structures interaction through rhythmic sequences:

- **Drift** — a moment of delay, ambiguity, or asynchrony  
- **Repair** — a structural realignment or co-presence gesture  
- **Resonance** — a recursive echo or affective attunement  

> The loop does not always close.  
> The continued presence of drift may be the most meaningful part.

> **Drift is not deviation — it's rhythm under construction.**

## 🧱 PLD as UX Pattern Units

These patterns appear repeatedly across systems —  
**thus we treat them as modular, not context-bound.**  
Each unit reflects a recoverable deviation or transition in user intent.

| PLD Term       | UX Design Parallel              | Example Usage                      | Pattern Example |
|----------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------|
| `Drift`        | Ambiguity / latency window       | Input pause, silent handoff        | — |
| `Repair`       | Clarification or fallback action | Soft prompts, retry suggestion     | [`rasa_soft_repair.yml`](https://github.com/.../rasa_soft_repair.yml) |
| `Resonance`    | Rhythmic feedback / echo         | Timing echo, loop rhythm           | [`figma_latency_hold.md`](https://github.com/.../figma_latency_hold.md) |
| `Reentry`      | Return path to dropped intent    | Resume from fallback               | [`llm_reentry_prompt.json`](https://github.com/.../llm_reentry_prompt.json) |
| `Latency Hold` | Designed pause or suspense       | Anticipatory shimmer, breath delay | [`figma_latency_hold.md`](https://github.com/.../figma_latency_hold.md) |

## 🧭 Lexicon Architecture Supplements

For extended guidance on **term relationships**, **usage safety**, and **activation patterns**, see:

- 📘 [LEXICON_CONNECTIVITY_MAP.md](./LEXICON_CONNECTIVITY_MAP.md)  
  → Outlines structural connections between core and derived terms, including activation chains and containment logic.

- 📘 [LEXICON_TIERING_GUIDE.md](./LEXICON_TIERING_GUIDE.md)  
  → Defines lexical tiers (`@core`, `@support`, `@derived`) and stability indicators for use in modeling and documentation.

> _These documents serve as scaffolds — not constraints — for navigating the Phase Drift lexicon._
