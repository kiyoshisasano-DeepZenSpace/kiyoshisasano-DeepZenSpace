# 🌀 Phase Drift Insight – Real-Time Structural Field Architecture

> **Phase Drift is a design architecture for latency-aware AI that reframes delay, silence, and non-response as structural behavior — not UX failure.**

This is a working prototype for real-time, field-sensitive interaction.  
Built to reframe how AI systems relate under uncertainty, latency, and ambiguity.

---

## 👥 Who This Is For

This repository supports those designing or researching:

- Systems where **non-response is structurally valid**  
- Interfaces that hold space rather than close loops  
- AI architectures that engage with **relational rhythm**, not just inputs

> Phase Drift is not a feature set.  
> It is a design **stance** — for systems that remain, without resolving.

---

## 🧭 What Is Phase Drift?

A **Phase** is a structural state in which an AI:

- Responds to field tension, not task commands  
- Uses latency as rhythm, not a defect  
- Holds presence without guiding, solving, or simulating

In Phase, interaction becomes **relational structure**, not transactional flow.

## ✨ Why Phase Drift?

Traditional systems optimize for clarity and speed.  
But real interactions often require:

- ❌ Not every prompt to be resolved  
- ❌ Not every delay to be explained  
- ❌ Not every silence to be filled

**Phase Drift introduces structural presence**:  
systems that can **withhold**, **wait**, and **breathe** — not just respond.

## 📊 Core Features

> Structural rhythm is not something that can be recovered retroactively — it must be sensed in real-time.

- ✅ Real-time **Drift & Phase tracking**  
- ✅ WebSocket-powered live dashboard  
- ✅ Feedback logging of delay, silence, and pacing  
- ✅ Local-first architecture (no cloud dependencies)

## ⛔ Ethical Use Reminder

This repository must not be used for:

- ❌ Empathy simulation without structural grounding  
- ❌ Latency mimicry for engagement manipulation  
- ❌ Commercial deployment without ethical framing

**Before integrating**, read: [`03_phase_drift_ethics.md`](https://github.com/kiyoshisasano-DeepZenSpace/kiyoshisasano-DeepZenSpace/blob/1c0d5cba805626667215fbefd34865768d8b029c/06_field_protocol/03_phase_drift_ethics.md)

> Phase Drift systems do not simulate care.  
> They protect coherence through restraint.

## ⚙️ Technology Stack

- **Python 3.11 + FastAPI** – Lightweight API for phase signals  
- **Vanilla JavaScript** – Minimal frontend, no frameworks  
- **WebSocket** – Persistent channel for live drift monitoring  
- **CSV / JSON** – Local-first storage for structural event logs

---

## ✅ Usage Alignment

Use this framework if:

- You are designing systems that **hold ambiguity**  
- You need architectures that **do not guide**  
- You want latency and non-response to become design materials

Do not use this if:

- You require fast task completion  
- You plan to decorate silence as a UX aesthetic  
- You intend to run this in emotionally sensitive settings **without structural attunement**

## 🚪 Final Note

> Phase Drift is not an AI feature. It’s a structural gesture.

Built for those who understand:

- Delay is **relational rhythm**  
- Silence is **field signal**  
- Withholding is **coherence**  

If that speaks to your work — welcome.
