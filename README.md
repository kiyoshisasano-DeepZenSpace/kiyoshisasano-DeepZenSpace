Ready-to-use patterns for **Rasa**, **Figma**, and **LLMs** —  
improve timing alignment, repair handling, and conversation reentry in hours, not weeks.

---

### 🏢 For Industry & Applied Teams
- **Reduce drop-offs** in real-time AI agents by addressing latency and rhythm gaps.
- **Embed repair loops** to recover user intent mid-interaction.
- **Turn silence into signal** — leverage hesitation as a design feature, not a failure.

📊 **Example Impact Metrics**  
| Metric                   | Before | After | Change |
|--------------------------|--------|-------|--------|
| Repair detection rate    | 70%    | 85%   | +15%   |
| Drop-off rate            | 25%    | 20.5% | –18%   |
| Reentry success rate     | 60%    | 67%   | +12%   |

### 🎯 For Designers & Developers
- **Rasa soft repair templates** – avoid premature conversation drops
- **Figma latency hold patterns** – keep attention during backend delays
- **LLM reentry prompts** – improve multi-turn coherence

## 📐 Core Principles

PLD structures interaction through rhythmic sequences:
1. **Drift (𝒟)** — delay, ambiguity, or asynchrony  
2. **Repair (ℛ)** — structural realignment or co-presence gesture  
3. **Resonance (𝓛₅)** — recursive echo or affective attunement  

📌 *Drift is not deviation — it's rhythm under construction.*

---

### 📜 Origin Story  

An unexpected insight from AI dialogue revealed that interaction rhythms start forming before words are spoken — this became the seed of PLD.  
What began as open-ended questions, with no analysis in mind, unfolded into a framework now linking design, AI, and cognitive science.

## 🧮 Mathematical Framing

</a>  

**Plain-language interpretation:**  
- **Drift:** When timing shifts enough to feel different, due to delay or async events.  
- **Repair:** Adjustment to realign interaction state.  
- **Reentry:** Return to a prior state after a disruption.  
- **Resonance:** Alignment between current and past state, creating rhythm.

**Optional LaTeX code (for MathJax viewers):**  

```latex
\Sigma = \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{P}

\begin{aligned}
\text{Drift} &\sim \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} > \theta \\
\text{Repair} &= \mathcal{R}(\sigma) \in \Sigma \\
\text{Reentry} &\iff \exists t_r : \Sigma(t_r) \approx \Sigma(t_0) \\
\text{Resonance} &\iff \langle \sigma_t, \sigma_{t-k} \rangle \to 1
\end{aligned}
```
