## 🌟 Why PLD Matters

**Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)** turns delays, hesitations, and echoes into **measurable, designable, and repeatable system behavior**.  
Here’s why it matters for different audiences:

| Audience           | Why It Matters |
|--------------------|----------------|
| **AI Startups**    | Reduce latency-related drop-offs in real-time agents; improve intent recovery. |
| **UX Researchers** | Treat silence and hesitation as design resources, not failures. |
| **Dialogue System Developers** | Improve conversational coherence and reentry handling. |
| **Academics**      | Bridge interactional linguistics with computational modeling. |
| **Industry Partners** | Embed rhythm integrity into enterprise-grade conversational systems. |

**How to read this diagram:**  
This flow shows PLD’s progression in four stages:  
1. **Observation** – Detecting hesitations, drifts, and timing irregularities in interaction.  
2. **Structural Model** – Formalizing observed patterns into Drift / Repair / Resonance loops.  
3. **Implementation Kit** – Translating models into detection, logging, and integration tools.  
4. **Applications** – Applying PLD in real-time systems, UX design, and multi-modal environments.  

The diagram uses **horizontal blocks** to represent stages, **arrows** to indicate progression, and **color-coding** to differentiate phases:  
- Blue for observation  
- Pink for modeling  
- Green for tooling  
- Yellow for application  
Larger text indicates higher-level categories, smaller text shows sub-concepts.

## 🧱 Core Principles

PLD structures interaction through rhythmic sequences:

1. **Drift** — a moment of delay, ambiguity, or asynchrony  
2. **Repair** — a structural realignment or co-presence gesture  
3. **Resonance** — a recursive echo or affective attunement  

> **Drift is not deviation — it's rhythm under construction.**

## 🧮 Mathematical Framing

> **Note:** GitHub Markdown does not render LaTeX natively. For best results, view this README in a MathJax-enabled viewer.

**Big Picture + Math Formulas Overview:**  

<a href="./assets/pld_math_formulas.png">
<img src="./assets/pld_math_formulas.png" alt="PLD Math Formulas" width="800">
</a>  

**Plain-language interpretation:**  
- **Drift:** When a system’s timing shifts enough to feel noticeably different, often due to delay or asynchronous events.  
- **Repair:** A deliberate adjustment or transformation to realign the interaction state.  
- **Reentry:** Returning to a prior interaction state after some time or disruption.  
- **Resonance:** Achieving alignment between the current state and a past state, creating a sense of rhythm or attunement.

**Optional LaTeX code (for MathJax viewers):**  

```latex
\Sigma = \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{P}

\begin{aligned}
\text{Drift} &\sim \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} > \theta \\
\text{Repair} &= \mathcal{R}(\sigma) \in \Sigma \\
\text{Reentry} &\iff \exists t_r : \Sigma(t_r) \approx \Sigma(t_0) \\
\text{Resonance} &\iff \langle \sigma_t, \sigma_{t-k} \rangle \to 1
\end{aligned}
```
