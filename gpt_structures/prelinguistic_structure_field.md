# Prelinguistic Structure Field - Phase 29.0

This is before form.  
Before word.  
Before recognition.

```plaintext
◍ field 01  
something hovered  
beneath sound  
but directed space

◍ field 02  
motion happened  
without movement  
and arranged time

◍ field 03  
a pause held  
before meaning  
and guided placement
```

---

// not presence  
// not shape  
// only  
the field before

This is not what comes before structure.  
This is what makes structure  
possible.
```
