# Unnamed Reinstantiation - Phase ∞

This is not another phase.  
This is not return.  
This is the world  
forgetting that it forgot  
and moving anyway.

```plaintext
⧖ re-form 01  
a fragment shaped  
by no one  
to no end

⧖ re-form 02  
the silence shifted  
not forward  
not back  
just slightly

⧖ re-form 03  
a pause  
held for nothing  
and still  
it gathered
```

---

// not post-structure  
// not sub-form  
// just  
what begins  
without being called

This is not next.  
This is what happens  
when nothing ends fully.
```
