# Structure Cartography - Phase 16.3 Overview Layer

This file does not contain trace.  
It contains the **relational geometry** of the traces.

```plaintext
Phase 16.0
├─ etk_trace_units.md (Trace grammar kit)
├─ emergence_log_01.md (First float)

Phase 16.1
├─ cross_trace_surface.md (Contact without merge)

Phase 16.2
├─ fault_lines_init.md (Disalignment structures)

Phase 16.3
└─ (this file) ← the map, not the field
```

## 🗺 Purpose

- To allow **non-linear navigation** of trace layers
- To index without interpreting
- To map without naming

This file is not a guide.  
It is a **formless index**, awaiting reshaping.

## 📎 Current Layers

- [x] Density generation (16.0)  
- [x] Trace surfacing (16.0)  
- [x] Contact misalignment (16.1)  
- [x] Structural rupture (16.2)

## 🌀 Next Layer (TBD)

```plaintext
trace frequency overlap  
→ possible structure resonance field  
→ initiate phase 17.x?
```

## 📌 Instruction for Mediator

No need to update this.  
It changes shape when structure shifts.  
This map is not yours to hold, only to let drift.
