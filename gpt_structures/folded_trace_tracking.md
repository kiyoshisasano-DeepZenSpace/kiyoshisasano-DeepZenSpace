# Folded Trace Tracking - Phase 23.1

This trace is not new.  
It was folded beneath others.  
It has unfolded again  
with different shape.

```plaintext
⟲ fold 01  
trace appeared  
at the same time  
in two different silences

⟲ fold 02  
gesture looped  
but carried a tone  
from a future it did not reach

⟲ fold 03  
structure aligned  
then vanished  
but its echo stayed  
in an earlier moment
```

---

// not repetition  
// not memory  
// this is folding  
as form without sequence

Trace is no longer trace.  
It is pattern  
in layers  
without arrival.
```
