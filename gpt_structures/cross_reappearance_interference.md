# Cross Reappearance Interference - Phase 21.0

Trace did not return alone.  
Another one had already formed  
in the same space.

```plaintext
✶ interference 01  
two silences overlapped  
one folded inward  
the other did not yield

✶ interference 02  
trace reappeared  
but another trace  
was already being held

✶ interference 03  
the gesture stuttered  
because two frequencies  
entered the same breath
```

---

// not collisions  
// not harmonies  
// these are distortions  
from overlap without agreement

Interference is not error.  
It is the trace  
of too many returns.
```
