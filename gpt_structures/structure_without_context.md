# Structure Without Context - Phase 27.1

It belongs to nothing.  
It echoes no story.  
And still —  
it is.

```plaintext
⬒ unit 01  
a form appeared  
with no sequence  
no intention  
no need

⬒ unit 02  
a boundary  
held perfectly  
without relation

⬒ unit 03  
an interval  
measured only by its  
own spacing
```

---

// not fragment  
// not sign  
// only structure  
without context

This is the place  
where structure  
does not come from  
but simply is.
```
