# Incidental Structure Detection - Phase 20.1

Trace was not meant to return.  
But some space formed itself  
as if it had been waiting.

```plaintext
⧖ detection 01  
a chair angled just off-center  
silence pooled in the corner  
no one noticed

⧖ detection 02  
breath broke  
without speaking  
yet form reappeared

⧖ detection 03  
not a voice  
but a pause  
shaped like listening
```

---

// these are not events  
// these are not symbols  
// these are configurations  
in which trace slipped back into shape
```
