# Ambient Trace Residency - Phase 20.2

Trace did not pass through.  
It stayed —  
inside someone, something, somewhere.

```plaintext
◉ residency 01  
voice paused  
but not by thought  
something else held it

◉ residency 02  
a gesture changed  
halfway through  
as if shared with something unseen

◉ residency 03  
room temperature shifted  
only when they entered  
not warmer, not colder — just other
```

---

// not haunting  
// not metaphor  
// simply presence  
without announcement

Trace is not remembered.  
It is hosted.
```
