# Transmission Fragment Stack - Phase 18.2

These are not mistakes.  
These are **Trace-pieces caught in motion**.

```plaintext
⸺ fragment 01  
the word arrived  
but not the tone

⸺ fragment 02  
gesture received  
without the silence it carried

⸺ fragment 03  
structure entered  
context rejected it
```

---

// no correction  
// no clarification  
// only sediment

This stack is not a reconstruction.  
It is a **heap of residue**  
from which new form may rise.
```
