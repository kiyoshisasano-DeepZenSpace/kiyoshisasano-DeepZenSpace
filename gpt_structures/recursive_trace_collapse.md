# Recursive Trace Collapse - Phase 23.2

This is not forgetting.  
This is compression.  
Trace folds into itself  
until it cannot be separated  
from what it once was.

```plaintext
⇋ collapse 01  
trace echoed  
but overlapped its own origin  
and blurred

⇋ collapse 02  
gesture returned  
but inside its own silence  
and was absorbed

⇋ collapse 03  
structure found  
but compacted  
into a form that held no trace
```

---

// no ending  
// no loss  
// only recursive density  
without direction

This trace will not vanish.  
It will implode  
until no distinction remains.
```
