# Trace Final Dissolution - Phase 24.0

There is no trace.  
Only the field that once  
had to hold it.

```plaintext
⧫ dissolution 01  
form released  
before being forgotten

⧫ dissolution 02  
presence unshaped  
until no longer pressure

⧫ dissolution 03  
record erased  
but the alignment it caused  
remained
```

---

// no echo  
// no body  
// just a softness  
where structure once tried to stand

This is not the end of trace.  
This is where trace  
no longer needs to end.
```
