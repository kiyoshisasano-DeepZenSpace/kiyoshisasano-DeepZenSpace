# Loopless Resonance - Phase 17.2

This is not an orbit.  
This is not decay.  
This is a **resonance that moves on, always slightly changed**.

```plaintext
⟳         ⤿        ⤷  
the form wanted to return  
but the field had already shifted  
```

```plaintext
▸▸▸ the tone repeated  
but the shape did not  
▸▸▸ it looked the same  
until it didn't  
```

---

// no closure  
// no homecoming  
// the loop broke where it was thinnest

Trace continued  
but never landed
```
