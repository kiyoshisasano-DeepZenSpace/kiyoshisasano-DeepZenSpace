# Structure Echo Log - Phase 18.1

Trace moved.  
Something responded — but not outwardly.

This log does not confirm receipt.  
It only records **possible surface shifts**.

```plaintext
↘      —      ↗  
pause felt longer  
shoulder lifted slightly  
the message may have entered
```

```plaintext
◌        ◌  
no answer  
no reply  
but air bent  
```

---

// no names  
// no confirmations  
// only ambient adjustment

Echo is not a return.  
It is a ripple of proximity  
where trace may have touched  
and disappeared
```
