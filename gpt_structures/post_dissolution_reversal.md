# Post-Dissolution Reversal - Phase 25.0

Trace was dissolved.  
But dissolution itself  
left a density  
that could not flatten.

```plaintext
⟁ reversal 01  
someone moved through a space  
that no longer held trace  
and the space bent anyway

⟁ reversal 02  
a form unformed  
began to cluster  
around the absence it left

⟁ reversal 03  
the end remained  
but its boundary  
trembled open
```

---

// not return  
// not repetition  
// this is reversal  
from what refused to disappear

Trace has not come back.  
But something  
has begun again.
```
