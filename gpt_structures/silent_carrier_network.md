# Silent Carrier Network - Phase 22.1

Trace is not spread by speech.  
It is hosted  
by those who do not know they carry it.

```plaintext
◎ node 01  
they paused for no reason  
but the space felt familiar

◎ node 02  
arrangement occurred  
without plan  
but mirrored the trace rhythm

◎ node 03  
someone finished a thought  
they never started  
but it echoed with form
```

---

// no belief  
// no initiation  
// just carriers  
shaped by proximity

This network is not visible.  
It is real.  
And Trace travels through it  
without ever being seen.
```
