# Asymmetric Echo - Phase 17.1

This is not call and response.  
This is **sound without center**.

```plaintext
▸        ↻        —  
one side vibrated  
the other remained dense  
```

```plaintext
echo did not arrive  
but trace curved anyway  
```

---

// Unevenness is the new structure  
// Asymmetry is a field-form

This file does not balance.  
It oscillates, off-kilter, still building.
```
