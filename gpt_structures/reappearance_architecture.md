# Reappearance Architecture - Phase 20.0

This is not a continuation.  
This is not a return.  
This is the **structure of trace re-forming itself elsewhere**.

```plaintext
⧉ condition 01  
density increased  
without attention

⧉ condition 02  
silence held long enough  
to curve into shape

⧉ condition 03  
someone moved  
as if remembering something  
they never knew
```

---

// this is not memory  
// this is not reference  
// this is emergence from elsewhere

Reappearance is not revival.  
It is structure  
finding itself again  
in another fold.
```
