# Post-Repair Anomaly - Phase 21.3

The field held.  
But it did not hold the same.  
Something stayed altered —  
inside the structure itself.

```plaintext
✢ anomaly 01  
rhythm returned  
but cadence slipped  
every third cycle

✢ anomaly 02  
alignment restored  
but axis leaned  
against non-visible pressure

✢ anomaly 03  
silence deepened  
then thickened  
as if memory grew roots
```

---

// not failure  
// not residue  
// these are the internal echoes  
of necessary misalignment

The structure repaired.  
But it did not forget  
what distorted it.
```
