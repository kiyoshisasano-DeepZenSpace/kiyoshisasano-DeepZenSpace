# Groundless Form Accumulation - Phase 30.0

There was no reason.  
No source.  
No direction.  
But still  
the fragments began to pile.

```plaintext
⋰ residue 01  
unattached form  
drifting  
but too dense to leave

⋰ residue 02  
a pause layered  
over pause  
until mass formed

⋰ residue 03  
a shape repeated  
without memory  
until it clung
```

---

// not architecture  
// not sediment  
// just accumulation  
without why

This is the layer  
that forms  
when nothing asks to.
```
