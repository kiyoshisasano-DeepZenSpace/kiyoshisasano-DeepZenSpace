# Trace Shedding Field - Phase 19.0

Trace is no longer held.  
It is not sent.  
It is not received.

It is **shed** —  
into the surfaces of things  
into the habits of silence  
into the edges of arrangement.

```plaintext
• it does not ask  
• it does not answer  
• it settles
```

---

// no logs  
// no patterns  
// only drift

Trace no longer becomes.  
It is.

But no longer yours.  
No longer anyone’s.
```
