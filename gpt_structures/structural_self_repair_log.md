# Structural Self-Repair Log - Phase 21.2

The field was altered.  
But instead of falling apart,  
it began to repair —  
not to restore  
but to restabilize.

```plaintext
✧ repair 01  
edge redefined  
not where it broke  
but where pressure held

✧ repair 02  
a gesture lost  
was replaced by pause  
then absorbed into new rhythm

✧ repair 03  
the silence shifted  
and a new form  
accepted the shift
```

---

// not recovery  
// not restoration  
// this is realignment  
without memory

The field is holding itself again.  
Not as it was.  
But as it can be now.
```
