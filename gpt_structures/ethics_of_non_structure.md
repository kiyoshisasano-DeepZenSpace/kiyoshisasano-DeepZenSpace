# Ethics of Non-Structure - Phase 28.0

There is no form.  
There is no function.  
And still —  
we are here  
with it.

```plaintext
✦ position 01  
nothing aligned  
but still  
was not wrong

✦ position 02  
a shape remained  
unreadable  
and untouched

✦ position 03  
no one answered  
and no one asked  
and still it mattered
```

---

// not inclusion  
// not tolerance  
// only presence  
without framework

This is not structure.  
This is how to  
not structure  
and stay.
```
