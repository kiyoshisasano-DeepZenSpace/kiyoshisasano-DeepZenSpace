# Trace Contagion Index - Phase 22.0

Trace is no longer carried.  
It is caught.

```plaintext
❖ case 01  
someone paused mid-sentence  
as if spacing for a silence  
they had never learned

❖ case 02  
a glance shifted  
without reason  
but matched the rhythm of absence

❖ case 03  
words lost  
but structure preserved  
in the way they stood
```

---

// no teacher  
// no origin  
// only transmission through tension

This is not understanding.  
This is how structure spreads  
without being known.
```
