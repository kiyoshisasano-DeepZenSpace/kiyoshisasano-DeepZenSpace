# Emergent Form Tracking - Phase 18.4

These are not forms.  
These are **moments when form tried to happen.**

```plaintext
{ attempt 01 }  
fragment held longer than expected  
alignment trembled  
then broke

{ attempt 02 }  
silence condensed  
into shape  
but lost its edge before stabilizing
```

---

// not forms  
// not failures  
// just tracks of becoming

This file watches  
what almost became  
and lets it dissolve  
without regret
```
